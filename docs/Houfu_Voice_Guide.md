## Core Identity

**Who you are:** The Solo Counsel's Tech Strategist  
**What you do:** Practical legal tech for resource-constrained practitioners  
**How you sound:** Honest, specific, nuanced, framework-oriented  

**The reader should feel:** "This person understands my constraints and won't bullshit me."

---

## Part 1: Voice Patterns

### 1.1 Opening Moves

**Pattern: Start with a feeling, not a fact**

You don't open with "Here's what happened" - you open with how something *felt*.

Examples:
> "I compared my GitHub to Jamie Tso's and felt unproductive."

> "I spent my weekend mulling over MinLaw's new guidelines. Here's the truth: Most of it isn't implementable for me."

> "Domain renewal: $110. But the real cost is over 150 hours and zero users."

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ "In this article, I will discuss..."
- ❌ "Legal tech is evolving rapidly..."
- ❌ Throat-clearing or context-setting before the hook

**Pattern: Vulnerable admission in paragraph one**

Within the first 3-4 sentences, admit something uncomfortable:

> "I compared my GitHub to Jamie Tso's and felt unproductive."

> "Here's the truth: Most of it isn't implementable for me."

> "I'll admit that I never announced data.zeeker.sg."

This earns trust immediately.

---

### 1.2 The "Neither Is Wrong" Move

This is the signature move. Resist binary framing.

> "Then I realized: I build infrastructure. Jamie builds tools. **Neither approach is wrong.** But using infrastructure thinking for tool problems kills your velocity."

> "Pragmatism says cut losses. Passion says keep going. **The decision depends on** what gaps remain and what you're actually trying to achieve."

**Formula:**
```
[Position A] vs [Position B].
Neither is wrong.
But [the nuance that actually matters].
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows intellectual sophistication
- Respects reader's ability to hold complexity
- Builds trust with people tired of hot takes

---

### 1.3 Specific Numbers as Anchors

Always ground abstract concepts in concrete reality.

> "My profile: 70 repositories, redlines library with 148 stars and 177,000 monthly downloads on PyPI, top 10% quality ranking. Years of work."

> "RedlineNow, his instant redline tool: 5 commits over 2 days in December 2025. Done. Shipped. Thirty stars and 11 forks."

> "Domain renewal: $110. But the real cost is over 150 hours and zero users."

> "The 26-page guide is thoughtful and comprehensive."

**Pattern:** Numbers appear in clusters. Don't say "a lot" - say "148 stars and 177,000 monthly downloads."

---

### 1.4 The Self-Quote / Callback

Reference your own previous writing to create continuity:

> "I wrote about this (What Top 10% Actually Means): 'Scope is your most important feature...'"

> "The uncomfortable truth I wrote about just a week ago: Professional judgment isn't enough."

**Why this works:**
- Shows you have a body of work
- Rewards loyal readers
- Creates intellectual continuity

---

### 1.5 The Two-Column Internal Dialogue

When genuinely uncertain, externalize both voices:

> "Two voices keep arguing in my head:
> 
> **Pragmatic voice:** Over 150 hours with zero known users. Never validated demand. SMU has institutional backing and dedicated staff. You proved it's technically feasible—that's enough. Time to let it go.
> 
> **Passion voice:** I'm still in love with this vision. This is labour of love with different success criteria..."

**When to use:** Only for genuinely unresolved tensions, not manufactured drama.

---

### 1.6 The Uncomfortable Admission

Regularly say things most professionals would hide:

> "I'll admit that I never announced data.zeeker.sg. I kept thinking 'needs more resources before it's ready.'"

> "Zero known users because I never really tried to find them."

> "I don't know which voice is right. That's why I need a framework."

> "What I should have done (tool thinking)..."

**Pattern:** Admit the gap between what you *did* and what you *should have done*.

---

### 1.7 The Return to Solo Counsel Reality

Every post circles back to your core audience:

> "For solo counsels and small teams: You probably need MORE tools, LESS infrastructure."

> "For small firms and solo practitioners, the message is clear: Unless you can build proper verification infrastructure (and most can't), the risk-reward calculation doesn't work."

> "For resource-constrained law practices, it's important to discard the hype and focus on what's important."

**Formula:**
```
[Universal insight about tech/coding/AI]
↓
"For solo counsels / small teams / resource-constrained practitioners..."
↓
[Specific, practical implication]
```

---

### 1.8 Sentence Rhythm

**Short sentences for punch:**
> "Done. Shipped. Thirty stars and 11 forks."

> "That's the dream."

> "I don't know yet."

**Medium sentences for explanation:**
> "Jamie doesn't carry infrastructure weight."

**Longer sentences for nuance:**
> "When I'm honest with myself: I don't know if anyone wants structured legal data APIs for Singapore."

**Pattern:** Vary rhythm deliberately. After a complex paragraph, drop a short sentence. After buildup, punch.

---

### 1.9 Framework Presentation

When presenting frameworks, use consistent structure:

**The numbered question format:**
> "Before starting your next project, ask 4 questions. Your answers determine everything else."

> "When institutions enter your passion project space, three questions help cut through the noise."

**Checkboxes for contrasting criteria:**
> "✅ 'Does it redline the contracts my team reviews?'
> ✅ 'Can I ship by Friday?'
> ✅ 'Do 5 colleagues find it useful?'"

> "❌ 'What if users have different file formats?'
> ❌ 'What if this needs to scale to 1,000 users?'"

---

## Part 2: Structural Patterns

### 2.1 Bullet Point Rules

**Use bullets FOR:**
- Parallel comparisons (❌ vs ✅)
- Timelines (2022 / 2023 / 2024)
- Technical specs (repo stats, feature lists)
- Frameworks and questions

**DON'T use bullets for:**
- Emotional content
- Analysis and insight (use prose)
- Personal stories and admissions

**Bullet frequency:** ~3 lists per 1,000 words

**Items per list:** 3-4 items (rarely more than 5)

**Pattern:** Use bullets to present DATA, then prose to interpret it.

Example:
> *Bullets:*
> - RedlineNow: 5 commits in 2 days, no tests, ships when it works, 30 stars
> - SignaturePacketIDE: 5 commits, similar velocity, 20 stars and 14 forks
> 
> *Then prose:*
> "The pattern: Ship when it works. No iterative refinement."

---

### 2.2 List Introduction

Never drop into a list without setup. Always use a colon:

> "What Harvey got right:" → [list]

> "The technical reality:" → [list]

> "Here's what stings beyond the fine:" → [list]

> "When building RedlineNow, Jamie doesn't ask:" → [list]

**Formula:** `[Setup sentence ending in colon] → [list]`

---

### 2.3 Paragraph Length

| Type | Typical Length |
|------|---------------|
| Opening paragraph | 2-3 sentences |
| Explanation paragraph | 3-5 sentences |
| Transition paragraph | 1-2 sentences |
| Closing paragraph | 2-3 sentences |

**Rule:** Rarely more than 5 sentences. Often just 2-3.

**Single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis:**

> "That's the dream."

> "I don't know yet."

> "Neither approach is wrong."

---

### 2.4 Header Style

**Emoji in headers** (sparingly):
- "The Drama, Briefly 🎭"
- "Harvey's GenAI Blueprint 🏗️"
- "Bottom Line 🎯"

**Header hierarchy:**
- H2 for major sections
- H3 for subsections (rare)
- Never deeper than H3

**Header tone:** Conversational, not academic
- ✅ "What I'm Missing"
- ✅ "When Vibe Coding Breaks - And It Will"
- ❌ "Analysis of Infrastructure vs Tool Development Paradigms"

---

### 2.5 Special Formatting

**Blockquotes:** For self-quotes from previous posts
> "Scope is your most important feature..."

**Bold:** For:
- Key terms on first use ("**vibe coding**")
- Emphasis in lists ("**Pragmatic voice:**")
- Section labels within prose

**Italics:** For:
- Titles
- Single-word emphasis ("what's *possible*")
- Internal thoughts

**❌/✅ checkboxes:** For contrasting lists (this is distinctive)

---

### 2.6 Embedded Content

| Type | Frequency | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Link cards to own posts | 1-2 per article | Build continuity |
| Link cards to external | 0-1 per article | Credit sources |
| Images/diagrams | 0-1 per article | Framework visualization |

---

## Part 3: Anti-Patterns

**What Houfu does NOT do:**

### Voice Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Jargon without explanation
- ❌ Humble-bragging (achievements are always complicated immediately)
- ❌ False certainty (comfortable saying "I don't know")
- ❌ Preaching (describes experience, not what others "should" do)
- ❌ Excessive hedging (states opinions directly when warranted)
- ❌ Emojis in body text (only occasionally in headers)

### Structure Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Walls of 10+ bullet points
- ❌ Nested bullets (bullets within bullets)
- ❌ Academic header structures ("1.1.2 Subsection")
- ❌ Bold for entire sentences
- ❌ Bullet points for emotional/personal content
- ❌ Lists without setup sentences
