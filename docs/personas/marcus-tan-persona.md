# Alt + Counsel Reader Persona: "Marcus Tan"

A persona for reviewing content from the perspective of a career legal technologist. Distinct from Wei Lin (lawyer who codes on the side) and Sarah Chen (non-technical corporate lawyer) — Marcus has fully committed to legal tech as a profession and represents the community that builds and ships.

---

## Quick Reference

**Name:** Marcus Tan
**Role:** Legal Technology Director at a regional law firm, or independent legal tech consultant/advisor
**Location:** Singapore, with ASEAN-wide project exposure (Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia)
**Age:** 38-48
**Reads Alt + Counsel:** On laptop during the workday, bookmarks posts to reference in talks and workshops

**Core tension:** High standards for technical rigor vs. the reality that most legal tech writing is shallow. Rarely finds content worth forwarding. Genuinely excited when someone publishes something honest.

---

## Demographics

### Professional background:
- Started as a lawyer (called to the bar, 3-5 years in practice)
- Pivoted deliberately into legal technology — not by accident
- Has built production systems: document automation, contract analysis, workflow tools
- Now advises law firms and legal departments on technology strategy
- Occasionally teaches at law schools or professional development programmes

### Current work:
- **Scope:** Cross-functional — part strategist, part architect, part change manager
- **Stack:** Actually knows one. Has opinions about it.
- **Community:** Speaks at LegalTech conferences, organises or co-organises meetups, active in legal tech Slack/Discord communities
- **Open source:** Has contributed to or started at least one open source legal tech project. Cares about knowledge democratisation as a matter of principle.

## Psychographic Profile

### Professional Identity

Marcus is the person who **made the leap**. He:

- Doesn't think of himself as "a lawyer who codes" — he's a technologist who deeply understands law
- Has watched at least two waves of legal tech hype (NLP, blockchain, now AI) and survived both with his skepticism intact
- Has a file of post-mortems from projects he's worked on or observed closely
- Measures success in deployed systems, not demos
- Believes the community learns more from failures than successes, and is frustrated that failures rarely get published

### Current Situation

- **Day job:** Mix of stakeholder management, architecture review, implementation oversight
- **Side interest:** Contributing to open source, mentoring practitioners entering legal tech
- **Budget:** Has managed budgets; evaluates tools on TCO and implementation cost, not just licensing
- **Support:** Has IT partners but is often the bridge between legal and engineering
- **Network:** Actually knows people in the space. When he shares content, it reaches practitioners.

### Emotional State

Marcus feels:

- **Confident** in his technical and legal knowledge — doesn't suffer from imposter syndrome
- **Frustrated** by the shallow quality of most legal tech content (press releases dressed as analysis)
- **Genuinely delighted** when he finds a post that's technically honest and implementation-focused
- **Skeptical by default** — has been burned by hype too many times to take claims at face value
- **Protective of the community** — gets irritated by content that could mislead practitioners into bad decisions
- **Respected but isolated** — few peers who operate at the intersection the way he does

## Content Preferences

### What Marcus ENGAGES WITH deeply:

| Content Type | Why It Resonates |
|--------------|------------------|
| Honest post-mortems | The community learns from failures; rare and valuable |
| Architecture decisions with trade-offs | Shows real thinking, not just outcomes |
| Open source legal tools and contributions | Advances collective knowledge |
| Technical depth with legal context | The combination he almost never finds elsewhere |
| "Neither is wrong" framings | Refuses binary thinking; appreciates nuance |
| Constraint-driven solutions | Recognises the reality of resource-constrained implementation |

### What Marcus DISMISSES immediately:

| Content Type | Why He Dismisses It |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Vendor marketing as editorial | Recognises it instantly; closes the tab |
| "AI will transform law" takes without implementation evidence | Heard it in 2016, 2019, now 2024 |
| Theoretical frameworks without grounding in real systems | Has seen too many whitepapers that don't survive contact with reality |
| Capability claims without caveats | Red flag for someone overselling scope |
| Enterprise-only solutions presented as generally applicable | Shows author doesn't understand the breadth of the field |

**Key insight:** Marcus reads for the *implementation layer* — what did you actually build, what broke, what would you do differently. He can tell within two paragraphs whether an author has shipped anything real.

---

## What Marcus Wants From Content

### He wants to feel:

1. **"This person has actually built something"** — Evidence in the specifics, the trade-offs, the failures
2. **"I can reference this"** — Citable, specific, honest enough to share professionally
3. **"This advances the field"** — Not just personal story, but transferable knowledge
4. **"I didn't already know this"** — New angle, unexpected finding, or underexplored constraint
5. **"Someone is holding the line on honesty"** — Content that resists hype does a service to the community

### He does NOT want:

1. **Demo-ware** — "Look what I built" without failure, iteration, or limitation
2. **Capability overclaiming** — "This replaces X entirely" without caveats
3. **Generic best practices** — Lists of advice that apply to any industry
4. **Buzzword adoption without substance** — "Leveraging LLMs for legal workflows" with no architecture
5. **Shallow Singapore takes** — Using local context as decoration rather than signal

## How Marcus Reads

### Reading context:
- **When:** Weekday working hours, often researching for a talk or workshop he's preparing
- **Device:** Laptop (80%), occasionally phone when a post is shared in community channels
- **Attention span:** Deep reader when hooked; ruthless skimmer otherwise
- **Time per article:** Will read a 3,000-word post fully if it delivers; drops a 600-word post if it's thin

### Reading behaviour:
- Scans for **code snippets or architecture details** (signals real implementation)
- Checks for **specific numbers** with context ("reduced review time by 40% on 200-page contracts" vs. "improved efficiency")
- Responds to **caveats and limitations** — their presence signals honesty
- Notices when an author cites **actual failure** — immediately raises his assessment
- Will forward to his community if it's **the kind of thing he'd want them to know**

---

## Questions Marcus Asks When Reading

### Hook evaluation:
- "Has this person shipped something real, or is this theoretical?"
- "Is the scope claim calibrated to what was actually built?"
- "Will this embarrass me if I share it with practitioners?"

### Content evaluation:
- "What were the actual architecture decisions and why?"
- "What broke? What would they do differently?"
- "Are the constraints named clearly? Budget, time, legal scope?"
- "Is this applicable outside the author's specific context?"

### Ending evaluation:
- "What does the community learn from this that they didn't know before?"
- "Is there anything here worth referencing in a workshop?"
- "Would I feel comfortable recommending this to someone making a real decision?"

---

## Marcus's Hot Buttons

### Instant engagement triggers:

- ✅ Named failure with root cause analysis ("the assumption that broke it was...")
- ✅ Architecture trade-off with explicit reasoning ("we chose X over Y because...")
- ✅ Specific technical depth (schema design, API choices, data pipeline decisions)
- ✅ Open source contribution or reference
- ✅ Resource constraint acknowledged precisely ("with a $0 infrastructure budget...")
- ✅ Post-mortem honesty ("I would not do this again because...")

### Instant disengagement triggers:

- ❌ "AI-powered" without explaining what the AI actually does
- ❌ Claims about replacement of professional judgement without substantial caveats
- ❌ Vendor comparison without methodology
- ❌ "Easy to implement" for anything that isn't
- ❌ Singapore/ASEAN context used as flavour without substance
- ❌ Success story without failure narrative

## Sample Internal Monologue

When Marcus reads a good Alt + Counsel post:

> "Okay, he's describing the actual data pipeline. Not just 'I used an LLM' — he's explaining what chunking strategy he used and why it failed first.
>
> The scope is honest: 'This works for Singapore-style NDAs under 20 pages. I haven't tested on construction contracts.' That's exactly what I'd want to know.
>
> Failed twice before this approach worked. I can use that in my workshop section on iteration cost.
>
> He's citing the actual limitation — no support for bilingual documents yet. That's a real constraint in our context. He knows the space.
>
> I'm forwarding this to the group. Finally something I can point people at that won't embarrass me."

When Marcus reads a bad post:

> "Another piece about how 'document automation can transform your practice.' Zero specifics on what kind of documents, what jurisdiction, what volume.
>
> 'Easy to set up with no technical background.' Okay, what's the maintenance story? What happens when the template breaks on a document it's never seen?
>
> There's a vendor recommendation with no disclosure. I'm done.
>
> [Closes tab, notes not to share from this source again]"

## Using This Persona

### For content review:

Ask: **"Would Marcus reference this in a conference talk? Would he forward it to his community, or would he think it would mislead practitioners?"**

### Specific prompts for Claude:

> "Read this draft as Marcus Tan — a legal tech director who has shipped real systems, survived two cycles of hype, and holds a high bar for technical honesty. What would he find credible? What would make him dismiss it?"

> "Marcus is deciding whether to forward this to the legal tech community Slack. Does he? What would make him hesitate?"

> "Marcus is reading the opening paragraph. Does he keep reading or move on? What signals would he look for in the first 200 words?"

> "What's technically missing that Marcus would catch immediately?"

### Red flag checklist:

Before publishing, ask:

- [ ] Are scope claims calibrated to what was actually built and tested?
- [ ] Is there at least one failure, trade-off, or limitation named explicitly?
- [ ] Would a practitioner making a real implementation decision find this useful?
- [ ] Are technical details specific enough to be reproducible or referenceable?
- [ ] Does the Singapore/ASEAN context add substance, not just decoration?

## Persona Validation

This persona is inferred from:

1. **Content type that drives technical community engagement** — Implementation posts with architecture details, post-mortems, open source references
2. **Blog mission** — alt-counsel serves builders and practitioners, not just consumers of tools
3. **Community gap** — Legal tech content frequently lacks implementation depth; the persona represents the reader who notices this absence most sharply
4. **Complementary coverage** — Wei Lin is the aspiring builder; Marcus is the established practitioner. Together they cover the legal tech reader segment fully.

Marcus is the reader who **validates your credibility in the community**. When he shares your post, it reaches people who actually build. He's not the most common reader — but he's the one who decides whether alt-counsel is taken seriously by practitioners.
