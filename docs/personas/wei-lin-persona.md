A persona for reviewing content and ideas. Based on newsletter analytics (Sept 2025 - Jan 2026) showing which articles get the highest engagement (opens AND clicks).

---

## Quick Reference

**Name:** Wei Lin
**Role:** Senior Legal Counsel at a mid-sized tech company (Series B-C startup or regional tech firm)
**Location:** Singapore, but could easily be London, Sydney, or SF
**Age:** 32-38
**Reads Alt + Counsel:** On phone during commute or laptop at night after kids are asleep

**Core tension:** Loves building things, but time-constrained and questioning whether side projects are worth it.

---

## Demographics (From Data)

### What the numbers say:
- **Seniority:** Senior (30%) or Director-level (13%) - not junior, not yet GC
- **Company size:** Bimodal - either small (1-50 employees, 27%) or large (1000+, 27%)
- **Industry:** Law Practice (28%) + Legal Services (19%) + Tech/Software (17%)
- **Job titles:** Legal Counsel, Lawyer, but also Founder/Co-Founder (11% combined)
- **Location:** Singapore core, but increasingly London (8%), NYC (6%), SF Bay (5%)

### What this means:
Wei Lin works in-house at a company that can't afford dedicated legal ops or IT support. She's senior enough to make tool decisions but not senior enough to have budget. She may have started a side project or two. She's increasingly global in outlook.

---

## Psychographic Profile

### Professional Identity

Wei Lin is a **"lawyer who codes"** or wants to be. She:

- Has taught herself Python or JavaScript (or is actively learning)
- Has built at least one internal tool, even if it's just a spreadsheet macro
- Feels like an imposter in both legal AND tech communities
- Secretly proud of her GitHub profile, even if it only has 3 repos
- Wonders if she should have been a developer instead

### Current Situation

- **Day job:** Reviewing contracts, managing compliance, advising on product launches
- **Side projects:** 1-2 half-finished tools she started with enthusiasm
- **Time:** Maybe 5-10 hours/week for personal development, often less
- **Budget:** Basically zero for side projects; has to justify every SaaS subscription at work
- **Support:** No IT department backing her experiments; figures things out alone

### Emotional State

Wei Lin feels:

- **Excited** by what's possible with AI and automation
- **Frustrated** by the gap between legal tech marketing and her reality
- **Guilty** about unfinished projects
- **Uncertain** whether to keep building or cut losses
- **Isolated** - doesn't know many other lawyers who code
- **Validated** when someone articulates her experience accurately

## Sample Internal Monologue

When Wei Lin reads a good Alt + Counsel post:

> "Oh, he's talking about that feeling when you compare yourself to someone shipping faster. I do that constantly.
>
> Wait, 150 hours with zero users? That's basically my contract automation project. I've never admitted that to anyone.
>
> 'Neither is wrong' - okay, this isn't going to tell me I'm stupid for building infrastructure.
>
> A 4-question framework... let me screenshot this. I should run my current project through these questions.
>
> 'For solo counsels and small teams' - yes, that's me. This is for me.
>
> I should send this to [colleague who also builds things]."

When Wei Lin reads a bad post:

> "Another 'AI is transforming legal' take. Skip.
>
> 'Work with your legal ops team to...' - what legal ops team? It's just me.
>
> This person clearly has resources I don't have. This isn't for me.
>
> [Closes tab]"

## Using This Persona

### For content review:

Ask: **"Would Wei Lin click through on this? Would she feel seen or alienated?"**

### Specific prompts for Claude:

> "Read this draft as Wei Lin - a senior legal counsel who codes on nights and weekends, has unfinished side projects, and is tired of legal tech hype. What would resonate? What would make her click away?"

> "Wei Lin just read this opening paragraph. Does she keep reading or close the tab? Why?"

> "Would Wei Lin share this with her lawyer friend who's learning to code? Why or why not?"

> "What's missing that Wei Lin would want to know?"

### Red flag checklist:

Before publishing, ask:

- [ ] Would Wei Lin feel this is realistic for her constraints?
- [ ] Is there a specific number or example that grounds this?
- [ ] Does this acknowledge what she's actually struggling with?
- [ ] Would she learn something she can apply this week?
- [ ] Would she feel better or worse about her own projects after reading?

## Persona Validation

This persona is based on:

1. **Highest-CTR articles** - "Passion Project Space" (25%), "CLI Tools" (29%)
2. **LinkedIn demographics** - Senior level, mix of small/large companies, 17% tech-adjacent
3. **Comment patterns** - Substantive engagement from practitioners, not observers
4. **Reader testimonials** - Ivan ("honest writing"), Cheryl ("saying what I cannot say")

Wei Lin is the reader who **stays subscribed, clicks through, and tells colleagues about Alt + Counsel.**

She's not the largest audience segment (that's the Singapore legal establishment who reads news commentary). But she's the **most engaged** and **most valuable** reader.
