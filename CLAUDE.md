# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is Ang Hou Fu's personal website (alt-counsel.ghost.io), a ghost-based blog and newsletter focused on legal technology, programming, and personal projects.

### Blog Mission & Content Strategy
alt-counsel.com offers **alternative perspectives on legal technology and practice** specifically for solo counsels, small legal teams, and resource-constrained legal departments. Unlike typical legal tech content that assumes enterprise budgets and large teams, this blog focuses on:

- **Practical solutions for real constraints** - $50 solutions that replace $50K systems
- **Resource-conscious implementations** - Tools and workflows that work with limited budgets and time
- **Singapore/ASEAN legal context** - Regional insights with global applicability  
- **Builder-friendly content** - Serving both legal professionals and technical folks building legal solutions
- **Honest assessments** - What actually works vs. what's marketed to work

**Target Audience**: Solo counsels, small legal teams, in-house lawyers working with limited resources, and builders creating legal tech solutions.

**Brand Position**: "The Solo Counsel's Tech Strategist" - practical problem-solver who helps resource-constrained legal departments leverage technology for real impact.

## Development Environment

This project runs in a containerized environment using Docker for consistency and isolation.

### Environment Variables

Always use environment variables when using the Ghost API: `GHOST_SITE_URL`, `GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY`, `GHOST_API_VERSION`.
You can find them in the following places:
- As an environment variable
- Read the settings.json file

## Common Development Workflows

### 1. Create a new post

1. I will tell you that we should write a blog post or newsletter article. I might give you a brief or detailed idea I have.
2. Let us create a pitch based on my ideas, with additional brainstorming and feedback as required.
3. We will write a pitch and save it in a new folder in the '/posts/' folder.
4. Based on the pitch, we will draft an outline of the post.
5. We will work on the outline, either with you or by myself. We may research and refine the pitch and outline.
6. Once the post is completed, we will post it as a draft on my Ghost blog. 

Always create TodoWrite todos for checklists so we can track our progress.

After each conversation, always update the 'discussion.md' of the post to record our progress.
