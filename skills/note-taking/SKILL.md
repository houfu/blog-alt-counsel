# Note Taking

## Overview

Maintain a continuous record of discussions, decisions, and progress for each blog post or newsletter article.

**Core principle:** Document conversations in real-time to preserve context, decisions, and evolution of ideas.

**Announce at start:** "I'm recording this discussion in discussion.md."

## Success criteria

The discussion record is complete when:

1. It captures the key points, questions, and decisions from the conversation
2. Someone could read it later and understand what was discussed and why decisions were made
3. It includes the date and context of the discussion
4. It preserves important details like research findings, alternative approaches considered, or constraints discovered
5. It's saved in the correct post folder as 'discussion.md'

## The process

### Step 1: Determine the post folder

- If working on an existing post, locate the post folder in `/posts/{post-short-title}/`
- If creating a new post, the folder should have been created during pitch generation
- If unsure, ask your human partner which post this discussion relates to

### Step 2: Check existing discussion.md

- Read the existing `/posts/{post-short-title}/discussion.md` if it exists
- Understand what has been discussed previously
- You will append or update, not replace

### Step 3: Capture the discussion

Record:
- **Date and context**: When this discussion happened and what triggered it
- **Key points**: Main ideas, questions asked, and answers received
- **Decisions made**: What was decided and why
- **Research or findings**: Any links, documents, or insights discovered
- **Next steps**: What comes next or what's left to do

Format as chronological entries with clear headers for each discussion session.

### Step 4: Save the record

- Create or append to `/posts/{post-short-title}/discussion.md`
- Use clear date headers like "## Discussion - 2025-10-16"
- Keep it concise but complete - future you should understand what happened

## When to use this skill

- After brainstorming sessions
- After generating or revising a pitch
- After significant research or feedback
- When your human partner explicitly requests it
- At the end of major milestones in the writing process

## Remember

- Write for future readers (including future you)
- Be concise but capture important details
- Use chronological organization
- Don't replace previous entries - append to them
- Focus on decisions and context, not just facts
