## 8. Singapore Academy of Law - Prompt Engineering for Lawyers

### Primary Source

**[Embargo] Microsoft and SAL - Prompt Engineering for Lawyers**
- Authors: Microsoft Corporation & Singapore Academy of Law
- Date: 2024
- Format: Official guide/handbook PDF
- Length: 15 pages

**Key Framework:**
The guide teaches the **Goal-Context-Expectations-Source (GCES)** framework for structuring prompts:

1. **Goal**: What do you want from the AI system?
   - "Clear description of the task"
   - "Provide clear objectives, whether for legal research, document drafting or case analysis"
   - "Be as specific as you can and use action verbs such as 'Draft', or 'Summarise'"

2. **Context**: Why do you need it and who is involved?
   - "Relevant background information, constraints around the instruction, and parties involved"
   - "Include the 'Persona' of the individual drafting the prompt and the intended audience"
   - "Few-shot learning" - include examples for the model to emulate

3. **Expectations**: How should the AI system best respond?
   - "Setting expectations as to how the output should be framed"
   - "Level of depth, detail, tone of voice (e.g. friendly, authoritative or firm)"
   - "Format (e.g. bulleted list, table, or concise summary)"
   - "Chain-of-Thought prompting: 'think through this step-by-step'"

4. **Source**: What reference material should the system use?
   - "Include a reference source, which could either be an internal document or external website"
   - "The more precise you are, the better"
   - "Explicitly filter content and include specific paragraphs, clauses or sections"

**Key Assumptions in the Guide:**

1. **Chat-based interactions**: "This guide provides fundamental prompt engineering techniques that are helpful across various **chat-based generative AI tools**" (emphasis added)

2. **Turn-by-turn conversation model**: All example prompts assume user enters prompt → AI responds → user validates → next prompt

3. **Tools mentioned**:
   - "General purpose generative AI tools" (ChatGPT-style)
   - Microsoft Copilot for Word, Outlook, Teams, PowerPoint, Edge
   - "Legal research and contract drafting tools incorporating generative AI"

4. **No mention of agents or autonomous loops**: The guide does not discuss:
   - Agent architecture
   - Autonomous task completion
   - Self-correction and iteration
   - Multi-step reasoning without user intervention
   - Framework-based vs. prompt-based approaches

**Specific Legal Use Cases Covered:**
- Contract Review and Drafting
- Dispute Resolution
- Litigation Support
- Mergers and Acquisitions
- Regulatory Compliance
- Client Communication and Billing

**Professional Guidance:**
- "Copilot, not autopilot"
- "Review and verify generated output before incorporating them into your work product"
- "Do not rely on an authority that you have not read"
- Confidentiality warnings about free vs enterprise AI services

**Notable Contributors (listed in Acknowledgments):**
Multiple Singapore legal professionals from firms including Clifford Chance, Dentons Rodyk, Linklaters, and SMU Centre for Computational Law

### Critical Importance for the Article

This document is **THE perfect example** of what's being taught to Singapore lawyers in 2024. It:

1. **Represents exactly the "old way"** your article critiques
2. **Is official and authoritative** - co-authored by Singapore Academy of Law and Microsoft
3. **Explicitly focuses on "chat-based generative AI tools"** - not agents
4. **Uses Goal-Context-Expectations-Source framework** - optimized for conversational interactions
5. **Has no awareness of agent architecture** - doesn't mention autonomous loops, frameworks, or the shift you're describing
6. **Was distributed at or around TechLawFest 2025** (marked "[Embargo]" suggesting coordinated release)

This is not a strawman - this is literally what Singapore's legal establishment is teaching lawyers about prompt engineering in 2025, and it's entirely focused on the 2024 conversational paradigm.

## 9. TechLawFest 2025 Program

### Primary Source

**TechLawFest 2025 Official Program**
- Event: TechLawFest 2025 - "Reimagining Legal in the Digital Age"
- Dates: September 10-11, 2025
- Location: Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Singapore
- Organizers: Singapore Academy of Law and Ministry of Law, Singapore

**Key Prompt Engineering Session:**

**"SESSION 1B: UNLOCKING THE POWER OF PROMPT ENGINEERING WITH GENERATIVE AI"**
- Presented by: Singapore Academy of Law and Singapore Corporate Counsel Association
- Time: 11:00AM - 12:00PM on BOTH Day 1 (Sept 10) and Day 2 (Sept 11)
- Location: Saraca Ballroom
- Description from program: "Curious about how generative AI can actually work in legal practice and legal departments? This dynamic, one-hour Prompt Engineering Foundations Workshop is designed for both junior lawyers (practice and in-house counsel) looking to sharpen their AI skills, and senior lawyers exploring the potential benefits of prompt engineering for their teams. You will experience first-hand how better prompts lead to better AI outputs, from clearer drafting to faster analysis and fewer AI hallucinations."

**Workshop Format:**
- Hands-on session where participants bring laptops/tablets
- Corporate context scenarios (drafting agreements, litigation)
- Real-time feedback on prompt design and accuracy
- Goal-Context-Expectations-Source framework emphasized

**Trainers/Facilitators:**
- Day 1: Mr Lawson Sim (LegalTech Associate, Bizibody Technology), Ms Serena Lim (Founder/Managing Director, Bizibody Technology), Mr Ezra Tay (Chief Legal & Compliance Officer, Travala.com), Ms Ruth Leong (Deputy Director, Singapore Academy of Law)
- Day 2: Mr Eric Chin (Director, NewLaw, PwC Singapore), Mr Rodney Yap (Senior Manager, NewLaw, PwC Singapore), Ms Leow Jiamin (Deputy Director, Singapore Academy of Law), Ms Ruth Leong (Deputy Director, Singapore Academy of Law)

### Critical Importance

This session ran **TWICE** at TechLawFest 2025, showing it was prioritized content. The session directly implemented the framework from the SAL/Microsoft guide, teaching lawyers the Goal-Context-Expectations-Source approach for "chat-based generative AI tools."

The timing is perfect for your article: TechLawFest occurred September 10-11, 2025, just ONE DAY before Simon Willison published his agent definition (September 18, 2025), and EIGHT DAYS before GitHub Copilot agent went GA (September 25, 2025). TechLawFest was teaching the 2024 paradigm literally days before the 2025 shift became formalized.

## 10. Ministry of Law Singapore - Guide for Using Generative AI in the Legal Sector

### Primary Source

**Guide for Using Generative AI in the Legal Sector**
- Authors: Ministry of Law, Singapore (with contributions from multiple Singapore law firms, SAL, IMDA, Singapore Courts, and others)
- Date: September 2025 (Draft for Public Consultation: 1-30 September 2025)
- Format: Official government guidance document
- Length: 26 pages + annex

**Document Purpose:**
"To set out general principles and good practices to encourage responsible, ethical and effective use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in Singapore's legal services sector."

**Key Framework Elements:**

1. **Three Core Principles:**
   - Professional Ethics (lawyer-in-the-loop, ultimate responsibility)
   - Confidentiality (data security, client protection)
   - Transparency (disclosure to clients)

2. **Five Implementation Steps:**
   - Step 1: Develop an AI adoption framework
   - Step 2: Diagnose and analyse needs
   - Step 3: Identify and evaluate GenAI tools
   - Step 4: Implementation and training
   - Step 5: Continuous review and improvement

3. **Use Cases Covered:**
   - Practice management (Clio Duo)
   - Legal research (WestLaw Edge, LawNet AI)
   - Document review (Lawdify, Relativity)
   - Contract analysis and review (LegalOn, Robin AI)
   - Document drafting (Spellbook, Harvey, CoCounsel)

**Critical Observations:**

1. **Tool Focus is Mixed:**
   - The guide references both chat-based tools (general purpose GenAI) AND agentic tools (Harvey, CoCounsel)
   - Acknowledges different tool types: "free-to-use tools, enterprise-level commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) tools with relevant data protections, and in-house developed GenAI systems"

2. **Prompt Engineering Approach:**
   - Section 4.4 (Implementation and training) mentions "Refine prompts to introduce clearer constraints, contextual details, and instructions"
   - References "Document best practices to guide users in crafting more effective prompts"
   - Still assumes prompt-based interaction model

3. **References SAL Guide:**
   - Multiple footnotes cite "Singapore Academy of Law and Microsoft Corporation, 'Prompt Engineering for Lawyers' (2024)"
   - Specifically references GCES framework guidance on "Professionalism", "Copilot, not autopilot", and "Disclosure"

4. **Professional Responsibility Focus:**
   - "Ensure there is a 'lawyer-in-the-loop'. Legal professionals must review, analyse, and verify all GenAI-generated output"
   - "Take ultimate responsibility for all work product"
   - "Exercise greater scrutiny when using GenAI tools outside areas of expertise"

5. **Hallucination Concerns:**
   - Extensive discussion of hallucinations as "a key consideration with GenAI systems"
   - Notes "the likelihood of hallucination can be significantly minimised through techniques such as grounding... or more systematically, through retrieval-augmented generation (known as RAG)"

**Notable Contributors Listed:**
- Allen & Gledhill LLP
- Clifford Chance Pte. Ltd.
- Dentons Rodyk & Davidson LLP
- Drew & Napier LLC
- Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP
- WongPartnership LLP
- Singapore Academy of Law
- Singapore Corporate Counsel Association Ltd
- Singapore Courts
- Law Society of Singapore

**Case Studies in Annex:**
The guide includes detailed implementation examples from major Singapore firms:
- Clifford Chance: Three-tier approach (everyday tools, core legal tools, custom solutions)
- Allen & Gledhill: On-premises LLM with Pand.ai (IMDA supported)
- R&T Singapore: AI Core Team structure with specialized roles
- WongPartnership: Comprehensive AI safety framework
- Dentons Rodyk: AI Committee with education-first approach

**References to TechLawFest:**
Section 4.5 explicitly recommends: "Monitor emerging technologies, such as through active participation in industry events such as the annual **TechLaw.Fest organised by the Ministry of Law and SAL**"

### Critical Importance for the Article

This document is significant because it:

1. **Is the official government position** - Ministry of Law's formal guidance for Singapore's entire legal sector
2. **Was released during TechLawFest 2025** (public consultation Sept 1-30) - overlapping with the event (Sept 10-11)
3. **References the SAL/Microsoft guide** - explicitly endorses the GCES framework
4. **Acknowledges both paradigms** - mentions both chat-based tools AND agentic tools (Harvey, CoCounsel), but implementation guidance still assumes prompt-engineering approach
5. **Shows the establishment's view** - this is what the Singapore government, courts, law society, and major firms officially recommend
6. **Promotes TechLawFest** - explicitly recommends attending TechLawFest to learn about emerging technologies

This creates a fascinating tension: The guide acknowledges agentic tools exist (Harvey, CoCounsel) but the implementation framework (Step 4: "refine prompts", "document best practices for crafting effective prompts") still assumes the chat-based, turn-by-turn interaction model. It's trying to bridge both paradigms but hasn't fully grasped the implications of agent architecture.

### Key Quote for the Article

From Section 4.4: "Refine prompts to introduce clearer constraints, contextual details, and instructions to steer model responses towards higher quality results. Document best practices to guide users in crafting more effective prompts."

This perfectly captures the paradigm gap - the guide recommends using agentic tools (Harvey, CoCounsel) but still teaches prompt-crafting techniques designed for chat-based interactions.

## 11. Anthropic Agent Skills Framework

### Primary Source

**Equipping Agents for the Real World with Agent Skills**
- URL: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills
- Source: Anthropic Engineering Blog (official)
- Date: October 2025
- Content: Official announcement of Agent Skills framework

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Agent Skills Definition:**
   - "Organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and load dynamically"
   - Modular, composable resources that extend agent capabilities
   - File-based structure with standardized YAML frontmatter

2. **Progressive Disclosure Architecture:**
   - **Tier 1 - Metadata layer**: Skill name and description loaded into system prompt at startup (minimal context usage)
   - **Tier 2 - Core documentation**: Full `SKILL.md` file loaded when Claude determines relevance
   - **Tier 3 - Supplementary files**: Additional resources (forms.md, reference.md, etc.) loaded contextually as needed
   - Keeps context windows efficient while allowing unbounded skill complexity

3. **Technical Features:**
   - **File-based structure**: Skills are directories containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter
   - **Code execution**: Skills can bundle executable scripts (Python, Bash) that Claude runs deterministically without loading into context
   - **Dynamic loading**: Claude intelligently decides which skill components to access based on task requirements
   - **Composability**: Multiple skills can work together, transforming general-purpose agents into specialized ones

4. **Real-World Applications:**
   - Example: PDF skill enabling document manipulation (filling forms, extracting fields)
   - Capabilities beyond base model knowledge
   - Domain-specific expertise packaged as reusable resources

**Platform Support:**
- Currently supported across:
  - Claude.ai
  - Claude Code
  - Claude Agent SDK
  - Claude Developer Platform
- Expanded features planned

### Critical Importance for the Article

This announcement is **extremely significant** for your article because:

1. **Formalizes exactly what you've been doing**: Your evolution from 3-page prompts to reusable skills wasn't just a personal optimization - it was anticipating the architectural pattern Anthropic has now formalized

2. **Validates the paradigm shift**: While TechLawFest taught prompt-crafting (GCES framework), Anthropic was building toward modular, reusable framework systems

3. **Perfect timing**: This announcement came in October 2025, just weeks after TechLawFest (Sept 10-11) and Simon Willison's agent definition (Sept 18). The industry formally adopted the skills-based pattern while Singapore lawyers were being taught to perfect single-turn prompts.

4. **Strengthens Section 3 ("Why Agents Change Everything")**: You can now cite official Anthropic documentation showing that progressive disclosure and reusable skills are the architectural direction, not just your personal preference

5. **Validates Section 4 (Case Study)**: Your personal journey from 3-page prompts → reusable skills wasn't idiosyncratic - you were building toward the same pattern Anthropic formalized as Agent Skills

6. **Reinforces the contrarian critique**: The Ministry of Law guide (Sept 2025) says "Document best practices to guide users in crafting more effective prompts" while Anthropic was building a skills framework that makes prompt-crafting obsolete for agentic tools

**Key Quote for the Article:**

"Agent Skills are organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and load dynamically... transforming general-purpose agents into specialized ones."

This perfectly captures the shift from prompt-crafting (one-time instructions) to framework-building (reusable, discoverable resources).

### Connection to Your Personal Evolution

**Your workflow in Section 4:**
- Built library of reusable skills
- Each skill defines patterns and principles
- Agent reads relevant skills before starting
- Applies framework to current task
- Iterates autonomously within guidelines

**Anthropic's Agent Skills framework:**
- Organized folders of instructions and resources
- Progressive disclosure (metadata → full docs → supplementary)
- Agent discovers and loads dynamically
- Composable and modular
- Transforms general agent into specialized one

You were building Agent Skills before Anthropic named them.
