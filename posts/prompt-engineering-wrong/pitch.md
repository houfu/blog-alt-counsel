# Pitch: TechLawFest Got Prompt Engineering Wrong (And Why That Matters)

## Core Argument

While TechLawFest 2025 showcased growing interest in prompt engineering, most lawyers are learning an outdated paradigm. They're being taught to craft perfect prompts for turn-by-turn conversations, but the tools that actually deliver value—like Claude Code, Cursor, and modern AI coding assistants—work fundamentally differently. They use agents: LLMs running in loops to complete complex tasks autonomously. This requires thinking in frameworks and reusable systems, not perfect one-time prompts.

## Structure

1. **The Inflection Point:** TechLawFest 2025 as evidence that legal professionals are embracing AI, but learning the wrong lessons at the wrong time

2. **Two Paradigms Contrasted:** "Old way" (2024: craft the perfect 3-page prompt for each scenario) vs. "New way" (2025: build reusable frameworks that agents execute)

3. **Why Agents Change Everything:** Technical explanation of agent architecture (Simon Willison's definition: LLMs in loops) and why this demands different thinking

4. **Case Study:** Your personal evolution from writing massive one-off prompts to building the skills system—30 minutes once, 100+ uses

5. **Practical Reality Check:** How to identify which paradigm your tools use, and what that means for how you should invest your learning time right now

## Target Outcome

Resource-constrained legal teams stop wasting time perfecting prompts for ChatGPT conversations and start building systematic frameworks for the agent-based tools that will actually transform their work.

## Target Audience

Solo counsels, small legal teams, and in-house lawyers who are starting to explore AI tools—especially those who attended conferences like TechLawFest and are trying to figure out where to invest their learning time.

## Brand Position

Contrarian tech strategist who tells resource-constrained legal professionals what they need to hear, not what's popular at conferences.
