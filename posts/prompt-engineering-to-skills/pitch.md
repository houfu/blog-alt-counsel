# Pitch: Why Prompt Engineering Felt Wrong (And What Skills Changed)

## Core Message

A personal newsletter about feeling out of step at TechLawFest 2025—sitting in a standing-room-only prompt engineering workshop, anxious because you don't use any of the frameworks everyone's learning, but confident because AI works for you daily. That same month, the tools changed fundamentally. Your instinct was right. This newsletter validates readers who feel like "prompt engineering doesn't fit my work" and drives them to read the full article explaining what actually changed and what to do instead.

## The Hook

Standing room only at TechLawFest. Everyone learning COSTAR and GCES. You sitting there thinking "I don't use any of this... am I doing AI wrong?" Turns out the tools were changing that exact month. Here's what I learned about trusting your instincts.

## Why This Matters to Readers

**Emotional connection:** Every lawyer knows the feeling of sitting in a professional development workshop thinking "this doesn't fit my actual work." This newsletter validates that instinct instead of dismissing it.

**Permission to experiment:** Readers who feel confused about prompt engineering get permission to trust their judgment. Maybe they don't need to learn what everyone else is learning. Maybe their instinct that "this doesn't solve my real problems" is actually right.

**Curiosity driver:** "Wait, what changed in September 2025? Should I stop learning prompts?" The newsletter creates enough curiosity to drive click-through to the full article.

## What the Full Article Delivers (Top 3 Value Props)

**1. A Working Example You Can Copy**
- Complete NDA review skill (ready to save and use immediately)
- Shows exact format: what to check, red flags, output format
- No coding required - if you can write a checklist, you can build a skill
- Concrete proof this is actionable, not theoretical

**2. Economics Breakdown**
- Vendor tools: $50/user/month = $600/year for solo counsel, $6,000/year for 10-person team
- Custom skills: $20-50/month regardless of team size
- Time investment vs. cost trade-off analysis
- Why this matters for resource-constrained legal teams

**3. Three-Way Decision Framework**
- Chat-based tools (ChatGPT, Claude.ai) - when to use, what they're good for
- Vendor tools (Harvey, CoCounsel) - when they make more sense than DIY
- Custom skills - when you should build your own
- Helps readers evaluate "is this approach right for MY practice?"

## Success Criteria

After reading this newsletter, readers should:
1. **Feel validated** - "I'm not alone in feeling like prompt engineering workshops don't match my work"
2. **Get curious about specific deliverables** - "I want that NDA review skill. I want to see the cost comparison. I want to know if this is right for me."
3. **Click through with clear expectations** - Know exactly what they'll get from the full article (working example, economics, decision framework)

## Key Elements to Include in Newsletter

1. **The TechLawFest moment** - Standing room only, everyone learning frameworks you don't use, that anxious feeling
2. **The timing reveal** - That same month (September 2025), the tools changed from chat to agents
3. **The personal discovery** - Following Simon Willison → saw agent patterns → connected to your problems → realized this was the answer
4. **One concrete example of the shift** - Brief glimpse of what "skills" means (e.g., "Instead of writing prompts each time, I now have reusable skills that work every time")
5. **Signal the three deliverables** - Tease the working example, economics, and decision framework
6. **The permission** - "If you felt like prompt engineering didn't fit your work, your instinct was right"
7. **Strong CTA** - "Read the full article to get the NDA review skill, see the cost breakdown, and figure out if this approach is right for your practice"
8. **NO detailed technical explanation** - Save that for the article. Newsletter creates curiosity, not comprehension.

## Tone

Personal, reflective, slightly confessional. "Here's what I got wrong, here's what I learned, here's why it might matter for you."

Like writing to a colleague over coffee, not presenting at a conference.

## Length Target

As long as needed to provide value. Could be 400-600 words if the personal story needs space to breathe. Better to be engaging and complete than artificially short.

The measure isn't word count—it's whether each paragraph moves the reader closer to understanding why this matters and wanting to read more.
