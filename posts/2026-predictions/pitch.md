# Pitch: My 2026 Legal AI Predictions (From the Trenches, Not the Boardroom)

## One-sentence thesis
While everyone predicts AGI and the death of the billable hour, here are five boring, testable predictions about what will actually happen with legal AI in 2026—with public accountability for my own usage and learning.

## What this post argues

Everyone's making grand 2026 predictions: agentic AI will transform everything, the billable hour will die, corporate legal adoption doubled to 52%. I've read all the predictions from Stanford HAI, Forbes, legal tech vendors, and BigLaw consultants. They're focused on what's technically possible and what enterprises will do.

This post makes five contrarian predictions grounded in actual practice, not boardroom aspirations. Each prediction comes with a commitment: I'll track my own behavior throughout 2026 and report back honestly. Some are optimistic (agentic AI for document review will actually work), some are skeptical (hallucinations won't be solved, most AI adoption will be performative theater), and some are learning predictions where I'm figuring it out as I go (how to identify real innovation pockets vs. checkbox exercises).

The tone is wry observer, tongue-in-cheek—not doom-and-gloom, but honest about the gap between hype and reality. Each prediction includes specific success criteria, what I'm actually doing to test it, and how readers can track along with me. By December 2026, we'll know which predictions held up and which aged terribly.

## Why it matters to alt-counsel readers

**For lawyers who code / legal technologists:** Shows implementation reality vs. vendor hype. Provides concrete experiments to try, open questions to explore together, and honest assessment of what's worth building vs. what's performative. The jagged frontier prediction addresses the core pain point of knowing WHEN to use AI, not just what it can do.

**For resource-constrained in-house lawyers:** Cuts through the noise to identify what actually deserves limited time and budget. Honest usage tracking (<20% real usage despite claims) validates what many suspect but won't say publicly. Provides practical decision framework: where can you safely use AI in 2026, where is it still too risky?

**Singapore/ASEAN context:** Challenges the local AI hype (Salesforce predictions about ASEAN leapfrogging) while staying open to finding real innovation pockets in the region.

## The 5 predictions

1. **Agentic AI will actually work for document review** - Success = using only AI/agents to redline and output contract reviews without touching Word. If I hand-write anything, it failed.

2. **The jagged frontier problem won't get better** - Knowing WHEN to use AI stays harder than knowing what AI can do. I'm building a decision framework through trial and error.

3. **Real usage will stay under 20% despite adoption claims** - Claims ≠ reality. I'll track my actual monthly usage publicly with raw percentages.

4. **The hallucination paradox stays unsolved** - Can't eliminate hallucinations without breaking generation. I'm figuring out if there's a structure/workflow to make them manageable (not solved, but manageable).

5. **Most AI adoption will be performative theater** - Checkbox exercises dominate, but real innovation happens in isolated pockets. I'm learning to recognize the difference and will call out examples.

## Structure

- **Opening:** Wry observer intro ("While everyone else is predicting AGI...")
- **Context:** Brief summary of mainstream predictions and what's missing
- **Five predictions:** Each with:
  - What I'm predicting (contrast with consensus)
  - My success criteria (specific, testable)
  - What I'm doing about it (experiments, tracking, learning)
  - How readers can follow along
- **Closing:** Commitment to December 2026 accountability post

## Target length
2,500-3,000 words

## Key sources to cite
- Stanford HAI predictions (measurement era, more realism)
- Above the Law (700+ hallucination cases, billable hour pressure)
- Aline/Salesforce predictions (agentic AI hype)
- Gartner warnings (40%+ agentic projects canceled)
- Contrast enterprise predictions with small team reality

## Tags

## Success criteria for the post itself
- At least one reader commits to tracking their own usage alongside me
- At least one legal tech builder shares their own contrarian prediction
- I don't chicken out when December 2026 accountability arrives
