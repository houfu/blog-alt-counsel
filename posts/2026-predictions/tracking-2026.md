# 2026 Legal AI Predictions - Tracking Thread

**Blog Post:** [My 2026 Legal AI Predictions (From the Trenches, Not the Boardroom)](https://www.alt-counsel.com/)

This file tracks my five predictions for 2026 throughout the year. Updates will be committed to this repository as they happen, providing a public audit trail of what actually occurred versus what I predicted.

## The Five Predictions

### Prediction 1: Agentic AI Will Actually Work for Document Review

**The Prediction:** 2026 is the year I complete routine contract reviews (NDAs, standard service agreements, SaaS contracts) using only AI and agents—without opening Microsoft Word.

**Success Criteria (binary test for each contract):**
- If I hand-write anything in Word → Failed
- If I complete review with AI/agents only → Success

**What I'm Tracking:**
- Contract type
- AI-only vs. manual fallback
- What broke (if anything)
- ~5 hours/month testing

**Status:** In Progress

**Updates:**
- *Updates will appear here as contracts are reviewed throughout 2026*

### Prediction 2: The Jagged Frontier Problem Won't Get Better

**The Prediction:** The fundamental problem isn't that AI fails at tasks—it's that we can't predict which tasks it will fail at. And that unpredictability won't improve in 2026.

**Working Hypothesis:** Use AI for repetitive tasks with easily catchable errors and low stakes. Avoid it for jurisdiction-specific legal interpretation, subtle errors, and high-stakes work.

**Success Criteria:** By year's end, I'll have a revised decision framework built from real failures, not theory. Not a perfect framework—an honest one showing where I got it wrong.

**What I'm Tracking:**
- Decision log (task, appropriateness, whether I misjudged the frontier)
- ~15 minutes/week logging
- Monthly pattern publication

**Status:** In Progress

**Updates:**
- *Decision log patterns will appear here monthly*

### Prediction 3: Real Usage Will Stay Under 20% Despite Adoption Claims

**The Prediction:** When I track my actual AI usage throughout 2026—not what I could use it for, but what I actually use it for—it will stay under 20% of my total work.

**Success Criteria:** Honest monthly tracking of actual usage percentage. Not "I have access to AI" or "I tried it once"—but "what percentage of my work actually involved AI in a meaningful way this month?"

**What I'm Tracking:**
- Last week of each month: review calendar and matter list
- For each deliverable: did AI contribute meaningfully?
- Calculate percentage, publish raw numbers monthly
- ~30 minutes/month tracking

**Status:** In Progress

**Monthly Usage Data:**
- *Monthly percentages will appear here*

### Prediction 4: The Hallucination Paradox Stays Unsolved (But Maybe Manageable)

**The Prediction:** You can't eliminate hallucinations without breaking what makes LLMs useful. The paradox stays unsolved in 2026—but we might figure out how to make hallucinations manageable.

**Three Approaches Being Tested:**
1. RAG with citations - AI must cite specific clause numbers when reviewing contracts
2. Two-pass review - AI drafts, different AI reviews for hallucinations, I spot-check
3. Locked templates - AI fills in blanks in pre-approved forms only

**Success Criteria:** By year's end, I'll know if any of these workflows make hallucinations manageable. Not "solved"—manageable.

**Status:** In Progress

**Updates:**
- *Workflow test results will appear here*

### Prediction 5: Most AI Adoption Will Be Performative Theater (And Here's How to Spot It)

**The Prediction:** Most AI projects will be checkbox exercises—"we tried AI"—without changing workflows. Real innovation will happen in isolated pockets.

**Theater Signals:** Announced with press release, no public iteration, no failure stories, measured by "we tried it."

**Innovation Signals:** Shared as work-in-progress, iterated publicly, includes what broke, measured by "we solved X problem."

**What I'm Tracking:**
- Monthly callouts flagging 2-3 examples
- Initial assessment when announced
- December 2026 verdict on whether I called it right
- ~1 hour/month reading announcements, tracking claims vs. reality

**Success Criteria:** By the final scorecard, I can articulate what signals separate real AI innovation from checkbox exercises.

**Status:** In Progress

**Monthly Callouts:**
- *Theater vs. innovation examples will appear here monthly*
