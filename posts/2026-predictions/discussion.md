# Discussion Notes: 2026 Legal AI Predictions Post

## AUDIT TRAIL: Key Decision Points

### Decision: Use Wry Observer Tone, Not Just Contrarian (2026-01-03, Session 1)

**Claude's Analysis:**
- Researched 2026 prediction landscape from legal tech, AI, and technology sources
- Identified three major themes: agentic AI, economic reckoning, business model disruption
- Found gaps: no predictions addressing resource-constrained teams, implementation reality, small team competitive dynamics

**Claude's Recommendation:**
Four potential framing options presented, but recommended "The Predictions Nobody Made" (counter-narrative to enterprise focus)

**User Decision:**
Preferred wry observer tone: "While everyone else is predicting AGI and the death of the billable hour, I'm here to predict the boring stuff that will actually happen."

**Rationale:**
Tone should be fun and tongue-in-cheek, not just serious contrarian. Fits alt-counsel brand better.

**Outcome:**
✅ Both audience reviewers responded positively to the tone. Legal tech reviewer: "wry observer works for this audience because lawyers who code tend to be pragmatists who've seen enough hype cycles."

### Decision: Drop On-Premise AI Prediction (#5) (2026-01-03, Session 1)

**Claude's Analysis:**
- User's original prediction: "Local AI can't be realized" (on-premise AI won't close UX gap)
- Audience feedback: Both reviewers said this was weakest prediction - "feels conventional, not contrarian enough"
- Legal tech reviewer suggested reframing to be more specific or contrarian

**Claude's Recommendation:**
Either drop prediction #5 or completely reframe with more specific contrarian angle

**User Decision:**
Drop it entirely. Explore alternative predictions from research gaps.

**Rationale:**
User agreed prediction lacked substance and wasn't compelling enough to stand on its own.

**Outcome:**
✅ Opened space for stronger prediction #5 (performative AI theater)

### Decision: Add "Performative AI Theater" as Learning Prediction (2026-01-03, Session 1)

**Claude's Analysis:**
- Identified missing theme from research: "wait and see" trap and failed AI projects
- Presented options including billable hour disruption, training gap, failed projects
- User suggested different angle: "many people will do some facial project or use case and be done with it. there will be pockets of innovation. if you hear about it, you better sit up!"

**Claude's Recommendation:**
Frame as: "Most AI projects will be performative theater, but a few pockets of innovation will actually matter - and you better pay attention"

**User Decision:**
Approved framing, but expressed concern: "i wonder if i have the substance to fill this now in the post"

**Rationale:**
Makes it a "learning prediction" - honest about not having framework yet, commits to developing pattern recognition publicly throughout 2026.

**Outcome:**
✅ Transforms potential weakness (lack of framework) into strength (vulnerable, public learning). Gives material to blog about throughout year.

### Decision: Strengthen Predictions with "What I'm Doing" Commitments (2026-01-03, Session 1)

**Claude's Analysis:**
- Both audience reviewers wanted actionable guidance: "what should I DO based on these predictions?"
- Corporate lawyer reviewer: "I don't just want to know what won't work - I want to know what I should bet my limited time and budget on"
- Legal tech reviewer: "Add a 'What I'm Building Based on This' section"

**Claude's Recommendation:**
Each prediction needs three elements:
1. What I'm predicting (contrast with consensus)
2. My success criteria (specific, testable)
3. What I'm doing about it (experiments, tracking, learning)

**User Decision:**
Approved. Provided specific criteria for predictions #1 and #4:
- #1: Success = no hand-writing in Word (if I do, either model can't follow instructions or I haven't figured out how to tell it)
- #4: Working on structures/workflows to make hallucinations manageable (not solved, but manageable)

**Rationale:**
Makes predictions accountable, testable, and gives readers something to follow along with.

**Outcome:**
✅ All 5 predictions now have clear success criteria and tracking mechanisms. Pitch is ready to draft.

## WHAT CLAUDE DID (Contributions)

### Research
- Comprehensive scan of 2026 predictions across legal tech, AI, and technology domains
- Read 5 major prediction articles in depth (Above the Law, Law.com, Forbes x2, Aline, Salesforce ASEAN, Stanford HAI)
- Identified major themes: agentic AI paradigm shift, economic reckoning/measurement era, business model disruption
- Documented gaps in existing predictions (resource-constrained teams, implementation reality, small team dynamics)
- Created detailed research.md with synthesis of all findings

### Audience Feedback
- Launched two reviewer agents (legal-tech-blog-reviewer, inhouse-lawyer-reviewer) for feedback on concept
- Synthesized feedback showing consensus (strong: #2, #3; weak: #1, #5) and disagreements (technical depth vs. accessibility)
- Extracted key insights: need actionable guidance, implementation reality, budget considerations

### Brainstorming & Refinement
- Explored 5 alternative predictions from research gaps when user wanted to drop #5
- Helped reframe user's "performative AI theater" idea into testable prediction
- Developed structure showing what mainstream predicts vs. what user predicts for each point
- Created framework for "what I'm doing" commitments

### Writing
- Drafted comprehensive pitch.md with one-sentence thesis, argument structure, all 5 predictions with success criteria
- Included target length, key sources, tags, and success criteria for the post itself

## WHAT WORKED / DIDN'T WORK

### Worked Well ✅
| What Claude Did | User Decision | Outcome |
|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| Presented 4 framing options with tonal differences | Chose wry observer (Option B) | Both reviewers validated tone works for audience |
| Got early audience feedback on concept | Used feedback to strengthen weak predictions | Avoided writing full post with flawed structure |
| Framed "lack of framework" as weakness | Reframed as learning prediction | Turned limitation into strength (vulnerable, trackable) |
| Asked for specific success criteria | User provided concrete, testable measures | All 5 predictions now have clear accountability |

### Didn't Work ❌
| What Claude Did | Problem | Lesson |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| Suggested angles Claude thought were strong | User's own predictions were actually better | Trust user's practice-based insights over research synthesis |
| Initial prediction #5 (on-premise AI) | Not contrarian enough, lacked substance | Some predictions need more development before inclusion |

## SESSIONS (Chronological Detail)

## Session 1: Brainstorming & Pitch Development (2026-01-03)

### Context
User wanted to make 2026 predictions after researching what others are predicting. Started with exploratory research request ("let's research what people have sarted discussing or predicted so far"), then developed into full brainstorming session.

### What Claude Did

**Research:**
- Conducted 5 parallel web searches across legal tech predictions, AI predictions, law firm tech trends, Singapore/ASEAN perspectives, and general AI trends
- Read in-depth: Above the Law (7 predictions), Law.com (9 BigLaw AI predictions - paywalled), Forbes (Bernard Marr - 7 legal tech trends, Rob Toews - 10 AI predictions), Aline (7 legal tech predictions), Salesforce ASEAN predictions, Stanford HAI faculty predictions
- Synthesized major themes: (1) Agentic AI as paradigm shift, (2) AI's economic reckoning (hype → measurement), (3) Business model disruption (billable hour), (4) Adoption statistics (23% → 52%), (5) Hallucination crisis persists, (6) Governance/regulation, (7) ASEAN regional perspectives
- Documented gaps: resource constraint reality, implementation gap, productivity paradox, Singapore/ASEAN small teams, hallucination reckoning, training/upskilling challenge
- Created research.md with full synthesis (381 lines)

**Analysis & Comparison:**
- User provided 5 initial predictions:
  1. Agentic AI makes improvements (document review without Word)
  2. People won't understand jagged frontier
  3. <20% real usage despite claims
  4. Hallucinations won't be solved
  5. Local AI can't be realized
- Compared user's predictions vs. consensus, showing why user's were stronger (contrarian but credible, experience-based, specific and testable)
- Identified user's predictions as better than Claude's suggested angles

**Brainstorming Process:**
- Used brainstorming skill to refine predictions
- Phase 1: Asked clarifying questions about each prediction
  - #4 (hallucinations): User explained technical insight - "we need AI to generate or hallucinate. if we introduce rules based solutions, we may throw the baby out of the bathwater"
  - #5 (local AI): Clarified user meant on-premise AI, not regional models - UX gap won't close
  - #3 (usage gap): Confirmed personal tracking approach makes it stronger, not weaker
- Phase 2: Explored tonal options (presented 4 options, user chose wry observer)
- Phase 2: Presented refined structure for all 5 predictions showing consensus vs. user prediction

**Audience Feedback:**
- Launched legal-tech-blog-reviewer agent
  - Strengths: #2 (jagged frontier) strongest, #3 (usage tracking) shows authentic builder mindset, tone works
  - Weaknesses: #1 needs technical depth (what kind of review? what tech stack? cost?), #4 needs legal context not just AI theory, #5 weakest (conventional, not contrarian)
  - Missing: "What should builders DO?" actionable implementation guidance, cost/budget reality
- Launched inhouse-lawyer-reviewer agent
  - Strengths: #3 resonates hard, #2 hits pain point, #5 speaks to compliance concerns
  - Weaknesses: #1 underbaked (what does "works" mean? what's the cost?), too high-level, missing practical stuff
  - Missing: Implementation reality (time, cost, failure modes), budget reality checks, "what should I do Monday morning?"
- Synthesized consensus: Keep #2 and #3 (strong), significantly rework #1 (needs specifics), drop or reframe #5 (not contrarian enough)

**Exploring Alternatives:**
- When user decided to drop #5, presented 5 alternative predictions from research gaps:
  1. Billable hour/pricing model disruption
  2. Training/upskilling gap
  3. "Wait and see" trap
  4. Failed AI projects
  5. Voice/ambient AI
- User chose #3 with different framing: "many people will do some facial project or use case and be done with it. there will be pockets of innovation"
- Helped reframe as: "Most AI projects will be performative theater, but a few pockets of innovation will actually matter - and you better pay attention"

**Refinement:**
- User expressed concern: "i wonder if i have the substance to fill this now in the post"
- Presented 3 options: (A) Make it learning prediction, (B) Start with rough framework now, (C) Drop it
- User chose Option A: "making it a learning prediction makes sense"
- Developed final structure with all 5 predictions including "what I'm doing" commitments

**Specific Criteria Gathering:**
- Asked user for success criteria for #1: "using AI and agents only, I am able to redline or output my contract review. if i need to hand write something in word, it means either the model can't follow my instructions properly, or i havent figured out how to tell it"
- Asked user for approach on #4: "figuring out whether there's a good enough structure to use to reduce hallucinations or make them manageable"

**Writing:**
- Drafted comprehensive pitch.md including:
  - One-sentence thesis
  - What post argues (contrarian to mainstream, grounded in practice, with accountability)
  - Why it matters to both audience segments
  - All 5 predictions with success criteria
  - Structure outline
  - Target length (2,500-3,000 words)
  - Key sources to cite
  - Tags
  - Success criteria for the post

### User Decisions

**Major Decisions:**
1. **Tone:** Wry observer, tongue-in-cheek ("While everyone else is predicting AGI and the death of the billable hour, I'm here to predict the boring stuff that will actually happen")
2. **Drop prediction #5:** On-premise AI UX gap not compelling enough
3. **Add new prediction #5:** Performative AI theater vs. real innovation pockets (as learning prediction)
4. **Structure all predictions with commitments:** Each needs "what I'm doing" and clear success criteria
5. **Make it accountable:** Public tracking, honest reporting, December 2026 scorecard

**Specific Criteria Provided:**
- Prediction #1 success: No hand-writing in Word (binary test each time)
- Prediction #4 approach: Figure out structures to make hallucinations manageable

### Outcomes

**Files Created:**
- `/workspace/posts/2026-predictions/research.md` - Comprehensive research synthesis (381 lines)
- `/workspace/posts/2026-predictions/pitch.md` - Complete pitch with all 5 predictions
- `/workspace/posts/2026-predictions/discussion.md` - This file

**Git Actions:**
- Created branch: `2026-predictions`
- Committed research file
- Pushed to GitHub
- PR opened: "Work in progress: 2026 predictions post"

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Exploratory research identified gaps in mainstream predictions
- ✅ User's own predictions were stronger than Claude's suggested angles
- ✅ Early audience feedback prevented writing full post with weak structure
- ✅ Reframing "lack of framework" as learning prediction turned weakness into strength
- ✅ Getting specific success criteria made all predictions testable and accountable

**What Didn't Work:**
- ❌ Initial prediction #5 wasn't contrarian enough - needed to explore alternatives
- ❌ First version of predictions lacked "what I'm doing" commitments - too abstract

### Next Steps
1. Draft the full post (2,500-3,000 words)
2. Run quality checks (content audit, audience review, backlinks)
3. Publish to Ghost and verify

## Final 5 Predictions (Locked)

1. **Agentic AI will actually work for document review**
   - Success: Using only AI/agents, redline and output contract reviews without touching Word
   - Doing: Testing workflows, refining prompts, tracking failures

2. **The jagged frontier problem won't get better**
   - Success: Build decision framework for when to use AI
   - Doing: Document failures where AI used inappropriately

3. **Real usage will stay under 20% despite adoption claims**
   - Success: Honest monthly tracking of actual usage
   - Doing: Public accountability with raw percentages

4. **The hallucination paradox stays unsolved**
   - Success: Can't eliminate hallucinations without breaking generation
   - Doing: Figure out structures/workflows to make hallucinations manageable

5. **Most AI adoption will be performative theater**
   - Success: Learn to recognize real innovation pockets vs. checkbox exercises
   - Doing: Call out examples publicly, develop pattern recognition framework
