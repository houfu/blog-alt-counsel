# Discussion Notes: 2026 Legal AI Predictions Post

## AUDIT TRAIL: Key Decision Points

### Decision: Use Wry Observer Tone, Not Just Contrarian (2026-01-03, Session 1)

**Claude's Analysis:**
- Researched 2026 prediction landscape from legal tech, AI, and technology sources
- Identified three major themes: agentic AI, economic reckoning, business model disruption
- Found gaps: no predictions addressing resource-constrained teams, implementation reality, small team competitive dynamics

**Claude's Recommendation:**
Four potential framing options presented, but recommended "The Predictions Nobody Made" (counter-narrative to enterprise focus)

**User Decision:**
Preferred wry observer tone: "While everyone else is predicting AGI and the death of the billable hour, I'm here to predict the boring stuff that will actually happen."

**Rationale:**
Tone should be fun and tongue-in-cheek, not just serious contrarian. Fits alt-counsel brand better.

**Outcome:**
✅ Both audience reviewers responded positively to the tone. Legal tech reviewer: "wry observer works for this audience because lawyers who code tend to be pragmatists who've seen enough hype cycles."

### Decision: Drop On-Premise AI Prediction (#5) (2026-01-03, Session 1)

**Claude's Analysis:**
- User's original prediction: "Local AI can't be realized" (on-premise AI won't close UX gap)
- Audience feedback: Both reviewers said this was weakest prediction - "feels conventional, not contrarian enough"
- Legal tech reviewer suggested reframing to be more specific or contrarian

**Claude's Recommendation:**
Either drop prediction #5 or completely reframe with more specific contrarian angle

**User Decision:**
Drop it entirely. Explore alternative predictions from research gaps.

**Rationale:**
User agreed prediction lacked substance and wasn't compelling enough to stand on its own.

**Outcome:**
✅ Opened space for stronger prediction #5 (performative AI theater)

### Decision: Add "Performative AI Theater" as Learning Prediction (2026-01-03, Session 1)

**Claude's Analysis:**
- Identified missing theme from research: "wait and see" trap and failed AI projects
- Presented options including billable hour disruption, training gap, failed projects
- User suggested different angle: "many people will do some facial project or use case and be done with it. there will be pockets of innovation. if you hear about it, you better sit up!"

**Claude's Recommendation:**
Frame as: "Most AI projects will be performative theater, but a few pockets of innovation will actually matter - and you better pay attention"

**User Decision:**
Approved framing, but expressed concern: "i wonder if i have the substance to fill this now in the post"

**Rationale:**
Makes it a "learning prediction" - honest about not having framework yet, commits to developing pattern recognition publicly throughout 2026.

**Outcome:**
✅ Transforms potential weakness (lack of framework) into strength (vulnerable, public learning). Gives material to blog about throughout year.

### Decision: Strengthen Predictions with "What I'm Doing" Commitments (2026-01-03, Session 1)

**Claude's Analysis:**
- Both audience reviewers wanted actionable guidance: "what should I DO based on these predictions?"
- Corporate lawyer reviewer: "I don't just want to know what won't work - I want to know what I should bet my limited time and budget on"
- Legal tech reviewer: "Add a 'What I'm Building Based on This' section"

**Claude's Recommendation:**
Each prediction needs three elements:
1. What I'm predicting (contrast with consensus)
2. My success criteria (specific, testable)
3. What I'm doing about it (experiments, tracking, learning)

**User Decision:**
Approved. Provided specific criteria for predictions #1 and #4:
- #1: Success = no hand-writing in Word (if I do, either model can't follow instructions or I haven't figured out how to tell it)
- #4: Working on structures/workflows to make hallucinations manageable (not solved, but manageable)

**Rationale:**
Makes predictions accountable, testable, and gives readers something to follow along with.

**Outcome:**
✅ All 5 predictions now have clear success criteria and tracking mechanisms. Pitch is ready to draft.

## WHAT CLAUDE DID (Contributions)

### Research
- Comprehensive scan of 2026 predictions across legal tech, AI, and technology domains
- Read 5 major prediction articles in depth (Above the Law, Law.com, Forbes x2, Aline, Salesforce ASEAN, Stanford HAI)
- Identified major themes: agentic AI paradigm shift, economic reckoning/measurement era, business model disruption
- Documented gaps in existing predictions (resource-constrained teams, implementation reality, small team dynamics)
- Created detailed research.md with synthesis of all findings

### Audience Feedback
- Launched two reviewer agents (legal-tech-blog-reviewer, inhouse-lawyer-reviewer) for feedback on concept
- Synthesized feedback showing consensus (strong: #2, #3; weak: #1, #5) and disagreements (technical depth vs. accessibility)
- Extracted key insights: need actionable guidance, implementation reality, budget considerations

### Brainstorming & Refinement
- Explored 5 alternative predictions from research gaps when user wanted to drop #5
- Helped reframe user's "performative AI theater" idea into testable prediction
- Developed structure showing what mainstream predicts vs. what user predicts for each point
- Created framework for "what I'm doing" commitments

### Writing
- Drafted comprehensive pitch.md with one-sentence thesis, argument structure, all 5 predictions with success criteria
- Included target length, key sources, tags, and success criteria for the post itself

## WHAT WORKED / DIDN'T WORK

### Worked Well ✅
| What Claude Did | User Decision | Outcome |
|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| Presented 4 framing options with tonal differences | Chose wry observer (Option B) | Both reviewers validated tone works for audience |
| Got early audience feedback on concept | Used feedback to strengthen weak predictions | Avoided writing full post with flawed structure |
| Framed "lack of framework" as weakness | Reframed as learning prediction | Turned limitation into strength (vulnerable, trackable) |
| Asked for specific success criteria | User provided concrete, testable measures | All 5 predictions now have clear accountability |

### Didn't Work ❌
| What Claude Did | Problem | Lesson |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| Suggested angles Claude thought were strong | User's own predictions were actually better | Trust user's practice-based insights over research synthesis |
| Initial prediction #5 (on-premise AI) | Not contrarian enough, lacked substance | Some predictions need more development before inclusion |

## SESSIONS (Chronological Detail)

## Session 1: Brainstorming & Pitch Development (2026-01-03)

### Context
User wanted to make 2026 predictions after researching what others are predicting. Started with exploratory research request ("let's research what people have sarted discussing or predicted so far"), then developed into full brainstorming session.

### What Claude Did

**Research:**
- Conducted 5 parallel web searches across legal tech predictions, AI predictions, law firm tech trends, Singapore/ASEAN perspectives, and general AI trends
- Read in-depth: Above the Law (7 predictions), Law.com (9 BigLaw AI predictions - paywalled), Forbes (Bernard Marr - 7 legal tech trends, Rob Toews - 10 AI predictions), Aline (7 legal tech predictions), Salesforce ASEAN predictions, Stanford HAI faculty predictions
- Synthesized major themes: (1) Agentic AI as paradigm shift, (2) AI's economic reckoning (hype → measurement), (3) Business model disruption (billable hour), (4) Adoption statistics (23% → 52%), (5) Hallucination crisis persists, (6) Governance/regulation, (7) ASEAN regional perspectives
- Documented gaps: resource constraint reality, implementation gap, productivity paradox, Singapore/ASEAN small teams, hallucination reckoning, training/upskilling challenge
- Created research.md with full synthesis (381 lines)

**Analysis & Comparison:**
- User provided 5 initial predictions:
  1. Agentic AI makes improvements (document review without Word)
  2. People won't understand jagged frontier
  3. <20% real usage despite claims
  4. Hallucinations won't be solved
  5. Local AI can't be realized
- Compared user's predictions vs. consensus, showing why user's were stronger (contrarian but credible, experience-based, specific and testable)
- Identified user's predictions as better than Claude's suggested angles

**Brainstorming Process:**
- Used brainstorming skill to refine predictions
- Phase 1: Asked clarifying questions about each prediction
  - #4 (hallucinations): User explained technical insight - "we need AI to generate or hallucinate. if we introduce rules based solutions, we may throw the baby out of the bathwater"
  - #5 (local AI): Clarified user meant on-premise AI, not regional models - UX gap won't close
  - #3 (usage gap): Confirmed personal tracking approach makes it stronger, not weaker
- Phase 2: Explored tonal options (presented 4 options, user chose wry observer)
- Phase 2: Presented refined structure for all 5 predictions showing consensus vs. user prediction

**Audience Feedback:**
- Launched legal-tech-blog-reviewer agent
  - Strengths: #2 (jagged frontier) strongest, #3 (usage tracking) shows authentic builder mindset, tone works
  - Weaknesses: #1 needs technical depth (what kind of review? what tech stack? cost?), #4 needs legal context not just AI theory, #5 weakest (conventional, not contrarian)
  - Missing: "What should builders DO?" actionable implementation guidance, cost/budget reality
- Launched inhouse-lawyer-reviewer agent
  - Strengths: #3 resonates hard, #2 hits pain point, #5 speaks to compliance concerns
  - Weaknesses: #1 underbaked (what does "works" mean? what's the cost?), too high-level, missing practical stuff
  - Missing: Implementation reality (time, cost, failure modes), budget reality checks, "what should I do Monday morning?"
- Synthesized consensus: Keep #2 and #3 (strong), significantly rework #1 (needs specifics), drop or reframe #5 (not contrarian enough)

**Exploring Alternatives:**
- When user decided to drop #5, presented 5 alternative predictions from research gaps:
  1. Billable hour/pricing model disruption
  2. Training/upskilling gap
  3. "Wait and see" trap
  4. Failed AI projects
  5. Voice/ambient AI
- User chose #3 with different framing: "many people will do some facial project or use case and be done with it. there will be pockets of innovation"
- Helped reframe as: "Most AI projects will be performative theater, but a few pockets of innovation will actually matter - and you better pay attention"

**Refinement:**
- User expressed concern: "i wonder if i have the substance to fill this now in the post"
- Presented 3 options: (A) Make it learning prediction, (B) Start with rough framework now, (C) Drop it
- User chose Option A: "making it a learning prediction makes sense"
- Developed final structure with all 5 predictions including "what I'm doing" commitments

**Specific Criteria Gathering:**
- Asked user for success criteria for #1: "using AI and agents only, I am able to redline or output my contract review. if i need to hand write something in word, it means either the model can't follow my instructions properly, or i havent figured out how to tell it"
- Asked user for approach on #4: "figuring out whether there's a good enough structure to use to reduce hallucinations or make them manageable"

**Writing:**
- Drafted comprehensive pitch.md including:
  - One-sentence thesis
  - What post argues (contrarian to mainstream, grounded in practice, with accountability)
  - Why it matters to both audience segments
  - All 5 predictions with success criteria
  - Structure outline
  - Target length (2,500-3,000 words)
  - Key sources to cite
  - Tags
  - Success criteria for the post

### User Decisions

**Major Decisions:**
1. **Tone:** Wry observer, tongue-in-cheek ("While everyone else is predicting AGI and the death of the billable hour, I'm here to predict the boring stuff that will actually happen")
2. **Drop prediction #5:** On-premise AI UX gap not compelling enough
3. **Add new prediction #5:** Performative AI theater vs. real innovation pockets (as learning prediction)
4. **Structure all predictions with commitments:** Each needs "what I'm doing" and clear success criteria
5. **Make it accountable:** Public tracking, honest reporting, December 2026 scorecard

**Specific Criteria Provided:**
- Prediction #1 success: No hand-writing in Word (binary test each time)
- Prediction #4 approach: Figure out structures to make hallucinations manageable

### Outcomes

**Files Created:**
- `/workspace/posts/2026-predictions/research.md` - Comprehensive research synthesis (381 lines)
- `/workspace/posts/2026-predictions/pitch.md` - Complete pitch with all 5 predictions
- `/workspace/posts/2026-predictions/discussion.md` - This file

**Git Actions:**
- Created branch: `2026-predictions`
- Committed research file
- Pushed to GitHub
- PR opened: "Work in progress: 2026 predictions post"

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Exploratory research identified gaps in mainstream predictions
- ✅ User's own predictions were stronger than Claude's suggested angles
- ✅ Early audience feedback prevented writing full post with weak structure
- ✅ Reframing "lack of framework" as learning prediction turned weakness into strength
- ✅ Getting specific success criteria made all predictions testable and accountable

**What Didn't Work:**
- ❌ Initial prediction #5 wasn't contrarian enough - needed to explore alternatives
- ❌ First version of predictions lacked "what I'm doing" commitments - too abstract

### Next Steps
1. Draft the full post (2,500-3,000 words)
2. Run quality checks (content audit, audience review, backlinks)
3. Publish to Ghost and verify

## Final 5 Predictions (Locked)

1. **Agentic AI will actually work for document review**
   - Success: Using only AI/agents, redline and output contract reviews without touching Word
   - Doing: Testing workflows, refining prompts, tracking failures

2. **The jagged frontier problem won't get better**
   - Success: Build decision framework for when to use AI
   - Doing: Document failures where AI used inappropriately

3. **Real usage will stay under 20% despite adoption claims**
   - Success: Honest monthly tracking of actual usage
   - Doing: Public accountability with raw percentages

4. **The hallucination paradox stays unsolved**
   - Success: Can't eliminate hallucinations without breaking generation
   - Doing: Figure out structures/workflows to make hallucinations manageable

5. **Most AI adoption will be performative theater**
   - Success: Learn to recognize real innovation pockets vs. checkbox exercises
   - Doing: Call out examples publicly, develop pattern recognition framework

## Session 2: De-Slop, Feedback, and Final Polish (2026-01-07)

### Context
Post was drafted and reached 2,800 words with comprehensive content, but user identified concern: "too much AI produced slop" - overly helpful formatting made it look AI-generated. Session focused on cutting length, addressing feedback, and final quality polish.

### What Claude Did

**De-Slopping & Length Reduction:**
- Cut from 2,800 words to 1,799 words (1,000+ word reduction)
- Deleted entire "What You Can Do Now" interim guidance section (~400 words)
- Deleted detailed three workflows breakdown in Prediction #4 (~200 words)
- Deleted checkbox-format red flags in Prediction #5 (~200 words)
- Converted all "What I'm doing" bullet lists to conversational paragraphs
- Removed formulaic transition phrases between sections
- Compressed accountability section and "What I'm Not Predicting" section

**Backlink Curation:**
- Used backlink_curating skill to search blog for relevant posts
- Added 3 new bookmark cards:
  1. "AI Just Beat Lawyers" → Prediction #1
  2. "The Solo Counsel Reality" → Prediction #3
  3. "When AI Makes You Look Busy" → Prediction #5
- Total: 6 bookmark cards well-distributed across predictions

**Tag Validation:**
- Used tag-registry skill to validate tags
- Fixed naming conventions: legal-tech → LegalTech, ai → AI, singapore → Singapore
- Removed non-canonical tags: predictions, productivity, legal-practice
- Final tags: AI, LegalTech, Singapore (3 canonical tags)

**User Edits Review:**
- Got feedback from both reviewer agents on user's personal edits
- Key user changes:
  1. Replaced "AI Just Beat Lawyers" bookmark with personal explanation (lines 19-22)
  2. Changed $50K to $500K for enterprise systems
  3. Added "OR NOT!" to hallucination heading
  4. Simplified success criteria to focus on personal accountability
  5. Changed tracking from #2026Predictions to Github PR updates

**Audience Feedback Synthesis:**
- Legal tech reviewer: Keep personal explanation, fix $500K→$50K, clarify Github mechanics
- Corporate lawyer: Restore evidence link, $500K hurts credibility, Github excludes non-technical lawyers
- Consensus: $500K→$50K critical for credibility, Github-only approach excludes broader audience

**Applied Fixes from Feedback:**
- Changed $500K back to $50K (critical for credibility)
- Restored "AI Just Beat Lawyers" bookmark + kept tightened personal explanation (Option B)
- Changed from "Github PR only" to hybrid: blog posts + Github for raw data
- Removed "brutally honest" performance language

**Content Quality Audit:**
- Ran comprehensive content-quality-auditor agent
- Fixed critical accessibility issue: Expanded agentic AI explanation
- Strengthened Prediction #5 with concrete examples (theater: ChatGPT wrapper; innovation: GitHub workflow)
- Specified three approaches for hallucination management
- Varied "December 2026" repetition (8 instances → varied phrasing)
- Fixed tone issues: "Totally boring" → "Nothing sexy, just reality"
- Fixed tone issues: "bullshit detector" → "spot the difference between real innovation and checkbox theater"
- Improved RAG paradox explanation for clarity
- Final word count: 1,887 words

### User Decisions

**Major Decisions:**
1. **De-slop aggressively:** Cut 1,000+ words, delete entire sections of instructional scaffolding
2. **$500K → $50K:** After feedback showing $500K damages credibility, changed back to $50K
3. **Evidence + Personal Voice (Option B):** Restore bookmark card for credibility + keep personal technical explanation
4. **Hybrid tracking approach:** Blog posts tagged #2026Predictions + Github for raw data (serves both audiences)
5. **Fix all audit issues:** Address all critical, moderate, and minor issues from quality audit

**Specific Edits Made:**
- Lines 19-22: Restored "AI Just Beat Lawyers" bookmark + tightened personal explanation about agents
- Line 8: Changed $500K back to $50K
- Lines 119, 129: Changed from "monthly" to regular updates (doesn't control schedule)
- Line 10: "Totally boring" → "Nothing sexy, just reality"
- Line 37: Expanded agentic AI definition for non-technical lawyers
- Line 47: Broke long 52-word sentence into two paragraphs
- Line 65: "post-October 3" → "after October 3's AI hallucination sanctions in Singapore"
- Line 79: Expanded RAG paradox explanation
- Lines 83-87: Specified three hallucination management approaches with bullets
- Lines 104-106: Added concrete theater and innovation examples
- Line 100: "bullshit detector" → "spot the difference"
- Varied "December 2026" repetition throughout

### Outcomes

**Files Modified:**
- `/workspace/posts/2026-predictions/2026-legal-ai-predictions.md` - Final polished post (1,887 words)
- `/workspace/posts/2026-predictions/discussion.md` - This file (session notes)

**Quality Improvements:**
- ✅ Cut AI-slop from 2,800 to final 1,887 words
- ✅ Added 3 strategic backlinks (6 total bookmark cards)
- ✅ Validated and corrected tags to canonical registry
- ✅ Fixed critical accessibility issues (agentic AI definition)
- ✅ Strengthened weakest prediction (#5) with concrete examples
- ✅ Addressed all audience feedback concerns
- ✅ Upgraded quality rating from B+ to A-

**Git Actions:**
- Working in branch: single-serving-bias
- Changes ready to commit after Ghost publication

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Aggressive de-slopping preserved substance while removing AI formality
- ✅ Audience feedback identified critical credibility issue ($500K) before publication
- ✅ Hybrid tracking approach (blog + Github) serves both audience segments
- ✅ Option B (evidence + personal voice) satisfied both reviewers' concerns
- ✅ Quality audit caught remaining issues and improved accessibility

**What Didn't Work:**
- ❌ Initial user edit ($500K) damaged credibility - caught by audience feedback
- ❌ Github-only tracking would have excluded 70-80% of target audience
- ❌ Some tone choices ("bullshit detector") too informal for professional context

### Next Steps
1. ✅ De-slop complete
2. ✅ Backlinks curated
3. ✅ Tags validated
4. ✅ Audience feedback addressed

## Session 3: Publication, Tracking Infrastructure, and Post-Mortem (2026-01-08)

### Context
Post was published to Ghost (went live at 00:33:52). User requested help with Unsplash search terms for images, then asked to create public tracking infrastructure for the 2026 predictions accountability mechanism.

### What Claude Did

**1. Unsplash Search Terms (for 5 predictions):**
- Prediction #1 (Agentic AI): "contract document automation", "AI legal technology", "digital workflow automation"
- Prediction #2 (Jagged Frontier): "jagged mountain ridge", "uncertain path fork", "boundary line abstract"
- Prediction #3 (Real Usage <20%): "empty workspace minimal", "gap between two sides", "measuring chart low"
- Prediction #4 (Hallucination Paradox): "optical illusion abstract", "mirage desert uncertainty", "paradox impossible geometry"
- Prediction #5 (Performative Theater): "theater mask performance", "stage curtain performance", "facade architecture false"

**2. Created Public Tracking Infrastructure:**
- Created `tracking-2026.md` with:
  - All 5 predictions with success criteria
  - Placeholders for updates throughout 2026
  - Participation framework (blog, PR submissions, comments)
  - Accountability commitment ($500 to legal aid if chickening out)
- Created branch `2026-predictions-tracking` from main
- Committed and pushed tracking document to remote
- Prepared PR description for Github PR #8

**3. Updated Published Post with PR #8 References:**
- Modified "Your Turn" section: Added Github PR #8 link, clarified what updates will show
- Modified "Want to follow along?" section: Added PR #8 link for data commits
- Changed "monthly updates" to just "updates" (no schedule commitment)
- Created safe update script that fetches current post first to avoid collision
- Successfully updated live Ghost post

**4. Git Operations:**
- Committed markdown updates to `2026-predictions` branch
- Pushed all changes to remote

### User Decisions

**Decision 1: Unsplash Search Terms**
- **Claude's Contribution:** Provided 5 sets of visual search terms matching each prediction theme
- **User Decision:** Approved ("that's fine. push")
- **Outcome:** ✅ Search terms capture the tone (uncertainty, theater, paradox, friction, automation)

**Decision 2: Tracking Branch and PR #8**
- **Claude's Contribution:** Created dedicated tracking branch with living document for 2026 updates
- **User Decision:** Instructed to create branch for "end 2026 with a PR that others can follow"
- **Outcome:** ✅ Branch created, tracking document committed, ready for PR creation

**Decision 3: Remove "Monthly" Schedule Commitment**
- **Claude's Contribution:** Initially wrote "monthly updates" in tracking references
- **User Decision:** "change back from monthly to regular. it's not going to control my schedule"
- **Outcome:** ✅ Changed to "updates" and "data commits" without frequency commitment

**Decision 4: Sync Before Editing Ghost Post**
- **Claude's Contribution:** Attempted direct update, got collision error
- **User Decision:** "there may be changes so sync first before editing"
- **Outcome:** ✅ Fetched current post first, then updated with correct timestamp

### Outcomes

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/workspace/posts/2026-predictions/tracking-2026.md` - NEW (149 lines, living document for 2026)
- `/workspace/posts/2026-predictions/2026-legal-ai-predictions.md` - Updated with PR #8 references
- `/workspace/temp/update-2026-predictions-safe.js` - Created for safe Ghost updates

**Git Actions:**
- Branch `2026-predictions-tracking` created from main
- Commit 1f04c9e: Added tracking document
- Branch `2026-predictions` updated with commit c7359d3
- All changes pushed to remote

**Ghost Publication:**
- Post status: PUBLISHED (went live 2026-01-08 00:33:52)
- Post URL: https://www.alt-counsel.com/my-2026-legal-ai-predictions-from-the-trenches-not-the-boardroom/
- Updated with PR #8 references in 2 places

**Public Accountability Infrastructure:**
- ✅ tracking-2026.md ready for monthly/regular updates throughout 2026
- ✅ Github PR #8 mechanism for transparent data tracking
- ✅ Published post directs readers to PR #8 for following along
- ✅ No monthly commitment (user retains schedule flexibility)

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Safe update script prevented collision by fetching first
- ✅ Living document structure allows incremental updates throughout year
- ✅ PR-based tracking provides transparency without forcing schedule
- ✅ Published post successfully references tracking mechanism

**What Didn't Work:**
- ❌ Initial attempt to update Ghost post without fetching current state caused collision
- ❌ Used `text.link()` which doesn't exist - had to fall back to plain text URLs
- ⚠️ `gh` CLI not available, required manual PR creation

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Post published
2. ✅ Tracking infrastructure created
3. ✅ PR #8 branch pushed
4. ⏳ Create PR #8 manually (gh CLI not available)
5. ⏳ Session notes and post-mortem (this update)

## Post-Mortem: 2026 Predictions Post (Complete Project)

### Project Overview
**Scope:** Create public 2026 legal AI predictions post with accountability framework and transparent tracking
**Timeline:** 3 sessions across 2 days (2026-01-07 to 2026-01-08)
**Final Deliverable:** 1,887-word blog post + tracking infrastructure + public Github PR

### Metrics

**Content Quality:**
- Start: 2,800 words (AI-sloppy with extensive scaffolding)
- End: 1,887 words (32% reduction, natural voice preserved)
- Quality rating: B+ → A- (after audience feedback and content audit)

**Workflow Efficiency:**
- 5 predictions refined through brainstorming
- 6 bookmark cards (backlinks to existing posts)
- 2 audience reviewer feedback cycles
- 1 comprehensive content audit (fixed 14 issues)
- 3 Git commits across 2 branches

**Accountability Infrastructure:**
- tracking-2026.md created (149 lines)
- Github PR #8 for public transparency
- $500 commitment if chickening out in December 2026

### What Worked Really Well

**1. Brainstorming Skill Refined Predictions**
- Started with 5 vague predictions
- Ended with specific, testable predictions with clear success criteria
- Prediction #5 changed from "on-premise AI UX gap" to "performative theater" (more contrarian, learning-focused)
- Each prediction now has "What I'm doing" commitment

**2. Audience Feedback Caught Critical Issues**
- $500K → $50K (credibility fix)
- Github-only tracking → Hybrid (blog + Github)
- Evidence removed → Hybrid approach (bookmark + personal explanation)
- Avoided publishing with damaged credibility

**3. De-Slopping Was Surgical**
- Cut 913 words without losing substance
- Removed: interim guidance section, red flags checklist, detailed workflow breakdowns, formulaic transitions
- Kept: all 5 predictions, accountability framework, personal voice, backlinks
- Result: Reads like blog post, not AI consultant deck

**4. Quality Audit Systematically Improved Post**
- Found 1 critical + 5 moderate + 8 minor issues
- Fixed accessibility gap (agentic AI explanation)
- Broke long sentences, expanded jargon (RAG paradox)
- Added concrete examples to weakest prediction (#5)
- Improved professional tone

**5. Tracking Infrastructure Enables Accountability**
- Living document (tracking-2026.md) can be updated throughout 2026
- Github PR provides transparent audit trail
- Published post links to PR #8 for readers to follow along
- No monthly commitment (user retains flexibility)

### What Didn't Work

**1. User's Initial Edits Needed Correction**
- Changed $50K → $500K (damaged credibility, caught by reviewers)
- Wanted Github-only tracking (would exclude 70-80% of audience)
- These were caught by audience feedback, but required backtracking

**2. Technical Friction with Ghost API**
- `text.link()` doesn't exist in lexical builder - had to use plain text URLs
- Update collision when post was open in editor - needed safe fetch-first approach
- `gh` CLI not available - had to provide manual PR creation instructions

**3. Tag Validation Revealed Inconsistency**
- User's tags included `legal-tech` (kebab-case) instead of canonical `LegalTech`
- Also: `predictions` not in registry, `productivity` not needed
- Required correction to canonical: `AI`, `LegalTech`, `Singapore`

### Key Lessons Learned

**1. Audience Feedback Is Non-Negotiable for High-Stakes Posts**
- Two reviewer perspectives (legal tech + corporate lawyer) identified different critical issues
- $500K credibility problem would have been published without feedback
- Hybrid tracking solution emerged from understanding both audiences

**2. De-Slopping Requires Ruthless Cuts, Not Polishing**
- Cut entire sections (400+ words at a time)
- Don't try to make formulaic transitions "less formulaic" - delete them
- Convert structured lists to conversational paragraphs
- Target: 30-40% word reduction for AI-generated drafts

**3. Content Audits Find What Authors Miss**
- Critical issue: Agentic AI undefined for non-technical readers
- Moderate issues: Long sentences, unexplained jargon, weak examples
- Minor issues: Tone inconsistencies, repetitive phrasing
- Systematic approach catches what manual review misses

**4. Tracking Infrastructure Needs Flexibility**
- User pushed back on "monthly" commitment multiple times
- Changed to "updates" and "regular" (no schedule commitment)
- Lesson: Public accountability yes, rigid schedule no

**5. Safe Ghost Operations Require Fetch-First**
- Direct edits cause collision if post open in editor
- Fetch current post → get updated_at timestamp → edit with that timestamp
- Prevents "someone else editing" errors

### Process Improvements for Next Time

**What to Keep:**
1. ✅ Brainstorming skill for refining predictions
2. ✅ Multiple audience reviewer feedback
3. ✅ Content quality audit before publishing
4. ✅ Aggressive de-slopping (30-40% word reduction)
5. ✅ Tag validation against canonical registry
6. ✅ Backlink curation for strategic connections
7. ✅ Tracking infrastructure for accountability posts

**What to Change:**
1. ⚠️ Run audience feedback BEFORE user makes personal edits (prevents backtracking)
2. ⚠️ Implement fetch-first pattern for ALL Ghost updates (avoid collisions)
3. ⚠️ Check lexical builder API capabilities before writing scripts (text.link doesn't exist)
4. ⚠️ Clarify schedule flexibility expectations early (avoid multiple "monthly" → "regular" changes)

**What to Add:**
1. 💡 Pre-publication checklist: de-slop → backlinks → tags → audience feedback → quality audit → publish
2. 💡 Template for accountability posts with tracking infrastructure
3. 💡 Safe Ghost update script pattern (fetch → edit → update)
