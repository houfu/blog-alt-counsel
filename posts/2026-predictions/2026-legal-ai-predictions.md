# My 2026 Legal AI Predictions (From the Trenches, Not the Boardroom)

**Published:** [Draft]
**Tags:** AI, LegalTech, Singapore

Stanford HAI faculty predict we're entering AI's "measurement era"—more realism, less hype. Forbes predicts agentic AI will transform legal workflows. Above the Law warns about 700+ hallucination cases. Salesforce thinks ASEAN will leapfrog with AI adoption.

They're all focused on what's technically possible or what enterprises will do. Nobody's predicting what will actually happen for solo counsels and resource-constrained practitioners who can't afford $50K systems.

So here are my five predictions for 2026—grounded in actual practice, testable throughout the year, and honest about what I don't know yet. Nothing sexy, just reality.

## Prediction 1: Agentic AI Will Actually Work for Document Review

**What everyone else predicts:** Agentic AI will transform everything! Autonomous systems will revolutionize legal work!

**What I'm predicting:** 2026 is the year I complete routine contract reviews (NDAs, standard service agreements, SaaS contracts) using only AI and agents—without opening Microsoft Word. No Word plugins, no hand-writing edits. Just prompting AI to output what I want.

Optimistic? Yes. But I think we're close:

Agents now run much longer and follow instructions correctly. Using skills, they can read and write DOCX format (including redlines). But we haven't achieved WYSIWYG editing—ordering someone to edit isn't the same as editing yourself. So we'll see how far this goes.  

**Success criteria (binary test for each contract):**

- If I hand-write anything in Word → **Failed** (either model can't follow instructions or I haven't figured out how to communicate properly)
- If I complete review with AI/agents only → **Success**

**What I'm doing:** Logging every contract review attempt in a spreadsheet - contract type, whether AI-only or I fell back to manual, what broke. NDAs first, then service agreements, then SaaS. ~5 hours/month testing. If agent frameworks hit a wall with nested conditionals or Singapore Employment Act clauses, I'll document exactly what broke.

## Prediction 2: The Jagged Frontier Problem Won't Get Better

**What everyone else predicts:** AI capabilities will improve! Models will get more reliable! Trust will increase!

**What I'm predicting:** The fundamental problem isn't that AI fails at tasks—it's that we can't predict *which* tasks it will fail at. And that unpredictability won't improve in 2026.

**Agentic AI explained:** Unlike regular ChatGPT where you write a prompt and get an answer, agents can plan multi-step workflows, use tools, and revise their own output. Tell an agent to "review this contract" and it reads the document, identifies issues, drafts comments, formats the output, and checks its own work. That's the difference between a chatbot and an agent.

The jagged frontier means AI excels at some tasks while failing spectacularly at others that seem similar:

{{< bookmark url="https://www.alt-counsel.com/singapore-court-rules-on-ai-hallucination-a-reality-check-for-small-firms/" title="Singapore Court Rules on AI Hallucination: A Reality Check for Small Firms" description="A Singapore lawyer cited a completely fictitious case authority generated by AI. The High Court ordered the lawyer to personally pay $800 in costs. Professional judgment isn't enough—the real problem is no QA tools for small firms." >}}

Lawyers got sanctioned because they didn't realize they'd crossed from "AI handles this well" territory into "AI will make things up" territory.

Better models won't fix this. GPT-5 or Claude Opus 5 might move the frontier, but they'll still have one. The real problem is knowing *when* to use AI, not just what AI can do.

**My working hypothesis:** Use AI for repetitive tasks with easily catchable errors and low stakes. Avoid it for jurisdiction-specific legal interpretation, subtle errors, and high-stakes work.

But this framework will probably fail—it's too simplistic. The real question isn't task type, it's context. An NDA might be low-stakes with a vendor but high-stakes with a strategic partner. I don't have a good way to capture that yet.

**Success criteria:** By year's end, I'll have a revised decision framework built from real failures, not theory. Not a perfect framework—an honest one showing where I got it wrong.

**What I'm doing:** Keeping a decision log. Every AI use: task, whether it was appropriate, whether I misjudged the frontier. ~15 minutes/week logging. Monthly I'll publish patterns - not every entry, just the interesting failures. This might be the prediction I fail at most visibly.

## Prediction 3: Real Usage Will Stay Under 20% Despite Adoption Claims

**What everyone else predicts:** AI adoption doubled to 52%! Legal departments are embracing AI! Usage is skyrocketing!

**What I'm predicting:** Claims ≠ reality. When I track my actual AI usage throughout 2026—not what I *could* use it for, but what I *actually* use it for—it will stay under 20% of my total work.

I learned this lesson from my 3-page prompt for an M&A term sheet:

{{< bookmark url="https://www.alt-counsel.com/when-building-gets-cheap-but-knowing-stays-expensive/" title="When Building Gets Cheap But Knowing Stays Expensive" description="In 2024, I spent hours crafting a prompt for an M&A term sheet. Beautiful output: color-coded risk tables, timeline diagrams. I never used it again. And I still don't know if it actually served clients better than a standard template. AI made building cheap—but it didn't make validation cheap." >}}

Building is cheap now. But *using* what you build requires changing workflows, training clients to expect different formats, and verifying every output. That friction doesn't disappear just because the technology improved. Verification takes time, clients expect Word docs with track changes, and after October 3's AI hallucination sanctions in Singapore, better safe than sorry.

Critiques guidelines that don't address solo counsel reality with limited budgets." >}}

**Success criteria:** Honest monthly tracking of actual usage percentage. Not "I have access to AI" or "I tried it once"—but "what percentage of my work actually involved AI in a meaningful way this month?"

**What I'm doing:** Monthly snapshot - last week of each month, review calendar and matter list. For each deliverable: did AI contribute meaningfully? Not "asked ChatGPT a question" but "AI did substantive work I would have done manually." Calculate percentage, publish raw numbers monthly. ~30 minutes/month tracking.

## Prediction 4: The Hallucination Paradox Stays Unsolved (But Maybe Manageable)

**What everyone else predicts:** Hallucinations will be solved! RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) will fix it! Better models will eliminate the problem! OR NOT!

**What I'm predicting:** You can't eliminate hallucinations without breaking what makes LLMs useful. The paradox stays unsolved in 2026—but we might figure out how to make hallucinations *manageable*.

**The paradox:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) means the AI pulls information from specific documents before generating its response—like giving it a library of pre-approved sources to cite. Vendors claim this "solves" hallucinations because the AI only uses real information. But here's the problem: generation inherently requires the possibility of hallucination. Lock down an LLM too tightly to prevent making things up, and you've just built a very expensive search engine that can't synthesize or reason.

The breakthrough won't be "solving" hallucinations. It will be creating structures and workflows where hallucinations are acceptable because they're caught early, verified systematically, or confined to low-stakes tasks.

I'm testing three approaches to see if any make hallucinations manageable:
1. **RAG with citations** - AI must cite specific clause numbers when reviewing contracts
2. **Two-pass review** - AI drafts, different AI reviews for hallucinations, I spot-check
3. **Locked templates** - AI fills in blanks in pre-approved forms only

Will report what actually works.

**Success criteria:** By year's end, I'll know if any of these workflows make hallucinations manageable. Not "solved"—manageable. Maybe hallucinations remain too risky for anything beyond drafting emails and marketing copy. We'll find out.

## Prediction 5: Most AI Adoption Will Be Performative Theater (And Here's How to Spot It)

**What everyone else predicts:** AI innovation everywhere! Transformation across the legal industry! Everything will be different!

**What I'm predicting:** Most AI projects will be checkbox exercises—"we tried AI"—without changing workflows. Real innovation will happen in isolated pockets. By December 2026, we'll still have lots of news releases and anecdotes, but something interesting will be worth highlighting.

{{< bookmark url="https://www.alt-counsel.com/when-ai-makes-you-look-busy-not-productive/" title="When AI Makes You Look Busy, Not Productive" description="Introduces 'workslop'—AI-generated work that looks polished but lacks substance. Research found 40% of workers encountered this problem." >}}

I like to think I can spot the difference between real innovation and checkbox theater. Let's see whether I score some hits this year.

**What this challenges:** Salesforce predicts ASEAN will leapfrog with AI adoption, unburdened by legacy systems. I'm skeptical. Legacy systems aren't the only constraint—regulatory uncertainty (post-October 3), risk tolerance, and training gaps matter too. By year's end, we'll know if ASEAN leapfrogging was real or just another prediction that ignored implementation reality.

**Theater example:** Vendor announces "AI-powered contract analysis" that's actually just keyword search with a ChatGPT wrapper. Press release → no follow-up → feature quietly disappears six months later.

**Innovation example:** Solo counsel publishes actual workflow with prompt chains, failure rates, and cost breakdown on GitHub. Iterates based on community feedback. Shares what broke, not just what worked.

**Theater signals:** Announced with press release, no public iteration, no failure stories, measured by "we tried it."

**Innovation signals:** Shared as work-in-progress, iterated publicly, includes what broke, measured by "we solved X problem."

**What I'm doing:** Monthly callouts flagging 2-3 examples - initial assessment when announced, December 2026 verdict on whether I called it right. ~1 hour/month reading announcements, tracking claims vs. reality.

**Success criteria:** By the final scorecard, I can articulate what signals separate real AI innovation from checkbox exercises. Not a perfect framework—an honest attempt based on examples tracked throughout the year.

## The December 2026 Accountability Post

Here's what makes these predictions different from the boardroom variety: I'm tracking them publicly, with specific success criteria, throughout 2026.

In December 2026, I'll publish the scorecard: what I predicted vs. what actually happened, what I learned from being wrong, and the full data (decision log from #2, monthly usage percentages from #3, theater vs. innovation verdicts from #5).

**Predictions I'm most likely to fail at:** #2 (jagged frontier framework - hardest to operationalize) and #5 (spotting theater - learning from scratch). 

**Most confident:** #3 (usage under 20% - friction is real) and #4 (hallucination paradox - the technical trade-off is fundamental).

**What success looks like:** I don't chicken out when December 2026 arrives. If I do? $500 to a legal aid organization in Singapore and public acknowledgment. Stakes make accountability real.

## Your Turn

I'll publish updates as blog posts tagged #2026Predictions, with raw data available on Github for anyone who wants to dig deeper. If you're running similar experiments, share your results—email, blog comments, or Github PR all work. December 2026, I'll compile findings with full attribution.

**Where I'm probably wrong:** Prediction #1 (agentic AI working feels too optimistic) and #5 (no framework yet for spotting theater).

Which prediction will age worst? Where am I too conservative or too optimistic? What am I missing?

If you think I'm completely wrong, save this post. We'll find out together in December 2026. You can't spin the results when the year is over.

See you in December with the data.
