# Building a Contract Review Skill for Claude Code: A Builder's Journal

## Pitch

A tutorial series documenting my journey building a contract review skill for Claude Code, written for lawyers who code. Rather than a polished "10 steps to mastery" guide, this is a real-time exploration of what Claude Code skills can do and how they work. Each post captures a development session - the experiments, the discoveries, the roadblocks, and the patterns that emerge. Through the lens of building a practical contract review assistant, readers will see concepts like file handling, document analysis, web research, and structured output in action. The goal isn't to create production-ready legal tech, but to show lawyers what's possible when they extend Claude Code for their practice. The series is open-ended - I'll write as I build, and we'll discover the patterns together.

## Format

Build-in-public journal entries, published as I make progress on the skill.

## Target Audience

Lawyers who code - legal professionals with some programming experience who want to extend Claude Code for their practice.

## Core Skill Focus

Contract Review Assistant that incorporates different patterns/activities as building blocks:
- Basic skill setup and file reading
- Contract analysis and information extraction (parties, dates, key terms)
- Checklist generation based on contract type
- Jurisdiction-specific logic
- Web research integration

## Approach

Document the actual development process, then collaboratively extract concepts and patterns during the writing phase. The technical depth is conceptual with examples - showing "what's possible" rather than deep debugging tutorials.
