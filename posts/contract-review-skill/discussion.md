# Discussion Log - Contract Review Skill Tutorial Series

## Discussion - 2025-10-24

### Initial Idea
Houfu proposed creating a tutorial series on how to write a law-related skill for Claude Code.

### Brainstorming Session

**Target Audience Decision:**
- Chose to focus on **lawyers who code** (legal professionals with programming experience)
- Rather than developers building legal tech or a mixed audience
- Aligns with Houfu's brand as "The Solo Counsel's Tech Strategist"

**Primary Goal:**
- Show concepts and patterns in practice so readers understand what skills can do for them
- NOT about building production-ready solutions (that would be too ambitious)
- About expanding mental models of what's possible

**Example Selection Process:**
Explored three options:
1. Contract Review Checklist Generator
2. Legal Memo Research Assistant
3. Client Intake Document Analyzer

**Decision:** Contract Review Assistant as the main skill, with document analysis (option 3) as one of the activities/chapters within it. This allows teaching fundamental patterns (file I/O, prompts, web research) through one cohesive legal task while showing how patterns apply to different scenarios.

**Technical Depth:**
- Initially considered deep dive (Option A) with full code, debugging, etc.
- Settled on **conceptual with examples (Option B)** - showing key snippets and "what's possible" rather than deep technical troubleshooting
- Rationale: Aligns better with expanding mental models, more accessible, allows flexibility for deeper follow-ups if there's demand

**Writing Approach:**
- Houfu comfortable documenting development process but uncertain about "extracting concepts" upfront
- **Decision:** Figure it out together during writing - Houfu builds and documents process, we collaboratively identify teaching moments and patterns as posts develop
- More authentic, allows format to evolve naturally

**Series Structure:**
Chose **Approach 1: Build-in-Public Journey**
- Each post = one development session
- Natural cadence, authentic voice, thinking out loud
- Open-ended series that evolves as the skill develops
- Trade-off: May meander, but fits Houfu's style and allows organic discovery

### Final Pitch

Working Title: "Building a Contract Review Skill for Claude Code: A Builder's Journal"

Format: Real-time exploration documenting actual development sessions - experiments, discoveries, roadblocks, patterns that emerge. Shows lawyers what's possible when extending Claude Code for their practice through practical contract review examples.

Series covers building blocks like:
- Basic skill setup and file reading
- Document analysis (extracting parties, dates, key terms)
- Checklist generation
- Jurisdiction-specific logic
- Web research integration

### Next Steps
- Houfu begins building the contract review skill
- Document development process as it happens
- Write first post when there's something meaningful to share
