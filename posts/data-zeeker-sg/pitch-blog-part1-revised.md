# Pitch: Blog Part 1 - "When Institutions Enter Your Passion Project Space"

I've carried a vision for years: build structured legal data infrastructure for Singapore, create apps on top, eventually something bigger. data.zeeker.sg was my closest attempt - 150+ hours building Singapore's first public legal news API, one working app (cookies.zeeker.sg), proved it's technically feasible. Then SMU Centre for Digital Law announced they're building legal data infrastructure with institutional resources, multi-year timeline, dedicated staff - everything I tried to do solo. My domain renewal arrives December ($110 for 2 years), forcing the question: should I continue or stop? For passion projects, "zero known users" and "institutions can do it better" don't automatically mean quit. This post explores the framework: when institutions enter your space, how do you decide? Assess overlap (what are they actually building?), identify remaining gaps (can you modify approach or is there complementary work?), clarify motivation (is this business needing ROI or labour of love with different success criteria?). I don't have my answer yet - I'm attending SMU's Nov 18 event first - but this framework helps solo builders think through continue vs. stop when the big players arrive.
