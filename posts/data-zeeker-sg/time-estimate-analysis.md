# Time Estimate Analysis: How Long Did data.zeeker.sg Actually Take?

**Problem:** We estimated 500-600 hours, but that feels too high given:
1. No manual content curation (it's automated)
2. Heavy AI assistance (Claude, Claude Code)
3. Evening/weekend sessions (1-4 hours each, not full workdays)

## What We Know for Certain:

**From git history:**
- 79 commits across 2 repos
- 36 unique days with commits
- Date range: May 15 - September 3, 2025 (~3.5 months)
- Peak days: 9 commits (Aug 10), 7 commits (Aug 23), 5 commits (Jun 22)

**What we DON'T know:**
- Actual session lengths
- Non-commit work (research, failed experiments, planning)
- Time spent with AI tools

## Estimation Approaches:

### Approach 1: Session-Based (Conservative)
**Assumptions:**
- 36 days with commits
- Average session: 2.5 hours
- Calculation: 36 × 2.5 = **90 hours**

**Problems:** Undercounts heavy coding days and non-commit work

### Approach 2: Intensity-Based (More Realistic)
**Assumptions:**
- Heavy days (7-9 commits): 10 days × 4 hours = 40 hours
- Medium days (3-6 commits): 15 days × 2.5 hours = 37.5 hours
- Light days (1-2 commits): 11 days × 1.5 hours = 16.5 hours
- **Coding subtotal: 94 hours**

**Plus non-commit work:**
- Research/learning Datasette, SQLite: 10-15 hours
- Planning/architecture: 10-15 hours
- Deployment/ops/DNS setup: 10-15 hours
- Failed experiments/debugging: 10-20 hours
- **Non-commit subtotal: 40-65 hours**

**Total: 135-160 hours**

### Approach 3: What Industry Data Suggests

**With AI assistance, developers report:**
- 2-5x productivity increase for code generation
- But similar or longer time for:
  - Architecture decisions
  - Integration work
  - Debugging AI-generated code
  - Learning how to prompt effectively

**Traditional estimate for this project (no AI):**
- 32k LOC at 50 LOC/hour = 650 hours
- With 3-5x AI speedup = **130-220 hours**

### Approach 4: The "Gut Check"

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- Does "2-3 weeks of full-time work" feel right? (160 hours ÷ 40 = 4 weeks)
- Or "3-4 weeks"? (120-160 hours ÷ 40 = 3-4 weeks)
- Compressed into 3.5 months of evenings/weekends

## Major Revisions Needed:

### OLD ESTIMATE (WRONG):
- Coding: 250-300 hours
- Content curation: 200-250 hours (INCORRECT - it's automated!)
- Everything else: 100-150 hours
- **Total: 500-600 hours**

### NEW ESTIMATE (More Accurate):
- Coding with AI assistance: 90-120 hours
- Research/planning/architecture: 20-30 hours
- Deployment/ops: 15-20 hours
- Failed experiments/debugging: 15-25 hours
- **Total: 140-195 hours**

**Call it ~150-200 hours to be safe.**

## What This Changes for the Blog Post:

**Instead of:**
> "600 hours over 7 months"

**Should be:**
> "150-200 hours over 3.5 months"

**Key narrative shift:**
- NOT "this took 600 hours despite AI assistance"
- BUT "AI cut this from ~650 hours to ~150 hours - that's still significant"

**The honest framing:**
- GenAI reduced time by 70-75%
- But 150-200 hours is still 4-5 weeks of full-time work
- Compressed into evenings/weekends = still exhausting
- And I still don't know if anyone uses it

## Recommendations:

**Option A: Be honest about uncertainty**
> "Git history shows 79 commits over 36 days. My typical evening coding session was 1-4 hours. Best estimate: 150-200 hours of actual work. That's 4-5 weeks of full-time work compressed into 3.5 months of nights and weekends."

**Option B: Focus on the effort, not the hours**
> "79 commits. 36 evenings and weekends. 32,000 lines of code. Claude Code helped generate much of it, but I still spent months of nights debugging, integrating, and making it work."

**Option C: Acknowledge the uncertainty**
> "How long did this actually take? Honestly, I don't know. I didn't track time. Git shows 79 commits over 36 days, but that doesn't count research, planning, or failed attempts. Maybe 150 hours? Maybe 200? Either way, it's weeks of work I can't get back."

## My Recommendation:

Use **Option C** - acknowledge you don't have precise data, give your best estimate (150-200 hours), and focus on the qualitative cost (evenings/weekends, opportunity cost, uncertainty about value).

The exact number matters less than:
1. GenAI reduced time but didn't eliminate it
2. You still don't know if it was worth it
3. The opportunity cost is real

**Questions to resolve:**
1. Does 150-200 hours feel more accurate than 500-600?
2. Can you recall any particularly long coding sessions that would shift the estimate?
3. Are there major time sinks we're missing?
