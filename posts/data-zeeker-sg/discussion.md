# Discussion Notes: data.zeeker.sg Post Series Planning

**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Context:** Planning blog post series about data.zeeker.sg journey

## Key Decisions

### Series Structure: 3 Posts
1. **Post 1: "346 Articles Later: The Real Cost"** (800-1200 words)
   - Quantify invisible labor (250-350 hours)
   - Opportunity cost analysis
   - DNS renewal creating decision point
   - NOT pre-committing to shutdown

2. **Post 2: "Building data.zeeker.sg: Technical Lessons"** (1200-1500 words)
   - What worked (Datasette, SQLite, FTS)
   - What was too expensive (manual curation at scale)
   - What AI could have done differently
   - Blueprint for next builder

3. **Post 3: "What I Learned at SMU's Legal Database Launch"** (1000-1500 words)
   - Written AFTER Nov 18 SMU event
   - What institutional model actually looks like
   - Decision about data.zeeker.sg's future based on SMU's scope
   - Possible outcomes: continue, collaborate, hand off, or close

### Timeline
- **Nov 4-7:** Publish Post 1 (Real Cost)
- **Nov 11-14:** Publish Post 2 (Technical Lessons)
- **Nov 18:** Attend SMU Centre for Digital Law launch event
- **Nov 25-Dec 2:** Publish Post 3 (Institutions + Decision)

### Why This Arc Works

**For Documentation (Primary Goal):**
- Post 1 documents the labor and opportunity cost
- Post 2 documents technical lessons learned
- Post 3 documents the transition/decision
- Complete record of the journey

**For SMU Preparation:**
- Writing Post 2 crystallizes technical insights
- Becomes prep work for conversations at Nov 18 event
- Can identify specific questions to ask SMU team

**For Flexibility:**
- Posts 1 & 2 don't depend on knowing SMU's scope
- Post 3 can be adjusted based on what's learned at event
- Decision remains open until after gathering information

**For Narrative:**
- Post 1: The Problem (unsustainable labor as individual)
- Post 2: The Learnings (what worked, what didn't)
- Post 3: The Future (what institutions can do, my decision)

## Important Context

### Current State
- data.zeeker.sg is live and working (100% uptime)
- 346 articles curated over 7 months
- DNS renewal coming up
- Haven't worked much on it recently
- Decision point: renew or let it expire?

### SMU Project
- Nov 18 event at SMU Centre for Digital Law
- Building "Singapore's first open empirical legal database"
- Hiring full-time Research Engineer + Research Assistant
- 3-year project timeline
- **Scope unknown until event**

### Goals for Post Series
1. **Document journey** before closing this chapter (personal closure)
2. **Brainstorm how to help SMU** (writing as thinking tool)
3. **Decide after event** whether to continue, collaborate, hand off, or close

### Key Insight
The decision ISN'T pre-determined:
- If SMU overlaps: consider handoff/shutdown
- If SMU is complementary: might continue differently
- If SMU is narrower: gaps might still justify continuing
- Multiple projects serving different needs is valid

## Framing Adjustments Made

### Original Framing (Rejected)
- "I'm shutting down data.zeeker.sg"
- Posts framed as explaining a done deal
- Focus on why individual can't sustain

### Revised Framing (Adopted)
- "DNS renewal coming, need to decide"
- Posts document journey and learnings
- Decision comes AFTER gathering information at SMU event
- Acknowledges multiple possible outcomes
- Writing helps think through the decision

## Key Phrases

**Post 1:** "I spent 350 hours building something valuable. That's also 350 hours I didn't spend on everything else."

**Post 2:** "data.zeeker.sg worked technically. Here's what to copy, what to avoid, and what AI could have done for me."

**Post 3:** "Whether data.zeeker.sg continues or not, the fact that SMU is investing validates that this work matters."

## Open Questions to Resolve While Writing

### For Post 1
- Include specific dollar calculations of opportunity cost?
- Name specific alternative projects I could have built?
- How vulnerable to get about the exhaustion?

### For Post 2
- How technical is too technical for alt-counsel audience?
- Include actual code/config examples?
- Share specific AI prompts for curation?
- Provide SQLite schema as downloadable?

### For Post 3 (After Nov 18)
- What is SMU actually building?
- How does it compare to data.zeeker.sg?
- Collaboration opportunities?
- What's my decision?

## Session 2: Refining Pitch and Research (Oct 27, 2025)

### Git History Analysis Completed
- Analyzed both GitHub repos: houfu/zeeker and houfu/zeeker-datasette
- **79 commits** across 2 repositories
- **32,468 net lines of code** (64,786 additions, 32,318 deletions)
- **Coding estimate:** 250-300 hours
- **Total project estimate:** 500-600 hours (coding + content curation + planning/ops/docs)
- **Key insight:** GenAI-assisted, but still required substantial time investment

**Git analysis saved in:** `git-analysis.md`

### Feedback from Reviewers
Used getting-feedback skill with two reviewers:

**Legal Tech Blog Reviewer:**
- **Recommendation:** Lead with Angle B (The Decision)
- "I built this massive thing" risks humble-brag territory
- DNS renewal + SMU event creates real urgency
- Suggested hook: "My DNS renewal invoice arrived... should I let it lapse?"
- Current pitch tries to do too much (achievement + decision + GenAI reality check)

**Corporate Lawyer Reviewer:**
- **Strong preference:** Decision-making over technical prowess
- Resonates with resource allocation under uncertainty
- Suggested title: "600 Hours, 346 Articles, Zero Known Users: Should I Renew?"
- Wants framework for sustainability decisions, not just your story
- **Critical gap identified:** Need to explain what problem you tried to solve

**Consensus:**
- ✅ Lead with decision/sustainability angle
- ✅ Opportunity cost framing resonates strongly
- ✅ "Possible ≠ worth it" cuts through GenAI hype
- ✅ Vulnerability is strength
- ❌ Explain the problem upfront
- ❌ Make SMU event central or cut it
- ❌ Expand "useless legal/technical information"

### Pitch Revision
**Updated pitch for Post 1:**
- Title: "600 Hours, 346 Articles, Zero Known Users: Should I Renew?"
- Opens with DNS renewal invoice ($30 but 600 hours is the real cost)
- Explains the problem: scattered legal info, paywalls, no structured data
- Introduces SMU as context for decision
- Focuses on decision/sustainability, not technical achievement
- Clarified: "useless legal AND technical information" learned

**Division of labor confirmed:**
- **Post 1:** Should I have built this? (decision/sustainability)
- **Post 2:** How should someone build this? (technical lessons)
- **Post 3:** What did I learn at SMU? (institutional model + my decision)

### Research on Singapore Legal Information Access
Completed comprehensive research using blog-research skill:

**Key findings:**
- **LawNet:** SGD 206.92/month (~USD 155) - significant barrier
- **Free case law:** Fragmented (3-month windows, no API, poor search)
- **Free legislation:** Comprehensive via Singapore Statutes Online
- **Legal news:** Scattered across 40+ sources, no centralization, no API

**The gap data.zeeker.sg filled:**
- Centralized legal news database with structured data
- REST API for programmatic access
- Full-text search across curated legal news
- Machine-readable format (AI training ready)
- Professional summaries
- CC-BY-4.0 open licensing
- Historical coverage beyond 3-month windows

**None of this existed before in free, public format.**

**Research saved in:** `research-legal-access-singapore.md`

**Source highlight:** Found a Jan 2023 blog post documenting access barriers and equity concerns, validating the problem is real and documented by third parties.

### Files Created This Session
- `git-analysis.md` - Detailed analysis of coding time from GitHub history
- `research-legal-access-singapore.md` - Comprehensive research on legal info access in Singapore
- Updated `pitch-1-real-cost.md` - Revised based on feedback
- Updated `discussion.md` - This file

### Key Decisions Made
1. ✅ Title approved: "600 Hours, 346 Articles, Zero Known Users: Should I Renew?"
2. ✅ Lead with decision angle, not technical achievement
3. ✅ Use real numbers from git analysis (79 commits, 32k LOC, 500-600 hours)
4. ✅ Frame GenAI as enabler but not time-saver
5. ✅ Explain the problem (legal info access gaps) upfront in post
6. ✅ Post 1 focuses on sustainability; Post 2 handles technical lessons

### Ready for Next Session
- Research complete and validates the problem was real
- Git analysis provides concrete numbers
- Pitch revised based on reviewer feedback
- Clear understanding of Post 1's scope (doesn't cannibalize Post 2)
- **Ready to draft Post 1**

## Session 3: Drafting Post 1 and Time Estimate Revision (Oct 27, 2025)

### Initial Draft Completed
- Created full draft of Post 1: "600 Hours, 346 Articles, Zero Known Users: Should I Renew?"
- Initial length: 2,116 words (~10-11 min reading time)

### Feedback: Too Bullet-Pointy and Long
User feedback: "too bullet pointy and needs way more pruning"

**Revisions made:**
- Removed bullet-point lists throughout
- Cut repetitive examples and sections
- Merged redundant content
- Eliminated "For Other Solo Builders" advice section
- More narrative flow, tighter prose
- **Reduced to 1,263 words (~5-6 min reading time)** - 40% cut

### Critical Discovery: Time Estimate Was Wrong

**Original estimate: 500-600 hours**
Based on:
- 250-300 hours coding (from git analysis using traditional LOC/hour)
- 200-250 hours content curation (WRONG - assumed manual curation)
- 100-150 hours everything else

**Reality check revealed:**
- Content is NOT manually curated - it's fully automated via RSS feeds
- GenAI assistance (Claude, Claude Code) significantly reduced coding time
- No time tracking data exists
- Work done in evening/weekend sessions (1-4 hours each), not full workdays

### New Estimate: Over 150 Hours

**More accurate breakdown:**
- 79 commits across 36 days
- Typical evening sessions: 1-4 hours
- Heavy days (7-9 commits): ~10 days × 4 hours = 40 hours
- Medium days (3-6 commits): ~15 days × 2.5 hours = 37.5 hours
- Light days (1-2 commits): ~11 days × 1.5 hours = 16.5 hours
- Plus non-commit work (research, planning, failed experiments): 40-65 hours
- **Total estimate: 150-200 hours**

**Final decision:** Use "over 150 hours across several months"
- Plausible, not conservative
- Honest about uncertainty
- Acknowledges AI's impact while showing work was still significant

### Why This Is a Better Story

**Old framing:**
"GenAI enabled it but still took 600 hours"

**New framing:**
"GenAI cut this from ~650 hours (traditional) to ~150 hours - that's 70%+ reduction, but 150 hours is still 4-5 weeks of full-time work compressed into months of nights and weekends"

**Advantages:**
- More honest (admits no time tracking)
- More impressive (shows AI's actual impact)
- Better supports the argument (GenAI reduces but doesn't eliminate cost)
- Focuses on qualitative cost (evenings/weekends, opportunity cost) over precise numbers

### Files Created/Updated This Session
- `600-hours-should-i-renew.md` - Complete draft of Post 1
- `time-estimate-analysis.md` - Detailed analysis of time estimate methodology
- Updated `discussion.md` - This file

### Post 1 Final Stats
- **Title:** "Over 150 Hours, 346 Articles, Zero Known Users: Should I Renew?"
- **Word count:** 1,248 words (~6 min reading time)
- **Key sections:**
  - The problem I thought I was solving
  - What 150+ hours built
  - Where the time went
  - The opportunity cost
  - The silence (no usage data)
  - The SMU question
  - The real question (sustainability)
  - What I'm learning
  - The honest question (need vs. ego)
  - Should I renew? (decision pending Nov 18)

### Key Revisions Made
1. ✅ Changed "600 hours" to "over 150 hours" throughout
2. ✅ Clarified content is automated, not manually curated
3. ✅ Emphasized GenAI assistance but remaining work
4. ✅ Admitted uncertainty about exact hours
5. ✅ Removed bullet-heavy sections
6. ✅ Cut 40% of original length
7. ✅ More narrative flow, less listy

### Ready for Next Session
- Post 1 draft complete and refined
- Time estimate corrected and documented
- Ready for final review or publication
- Can proceed to Post 2 (Technical Lessons)
