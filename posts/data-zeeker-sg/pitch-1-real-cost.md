# Pitch: Post 1 - "600 Hours, 346 Articles, Zero Known Users: Should I Renew?"

My DNS renewal invoice arrived last week. Another year of data.zeeker.sg costs $30 - but that's not the real cost. I'm staring at git history showing 600 hours of work: building Singapore's first public legal data API, curating 346 legal news articles with AI assistance, learning obscure legal and technical information I'll never use again. And here's the part that keeps me up: I have no idea if anyone actually needs this. No usage analytics, minimal feedback, just... silence. GenAI made building public infrastructure technically possible for one solo lawyer. But should I have? The problem I tried to solve was real - Singapore legal information scattered across paywalled sources, no structured data for AI training, expensive barriers to legal research. So I built the solution: free API, clean data, CC-BY-4.0 license, exactly what I wished existed. Then SMU Centre for Digital Law announced they're launching their legal database on Nov 18. Institutions doing what I tried to do solo. Which brings me back to the renewal decision: what was this 600 hours actually worth? What else could it have produced? This post breaks down the real cost of building something no one asked for - not just dollars and hours, but opportunity cost, the weight of "useless" knowledge, and the question every solo builder faces: just because you can doesn't mean you should.
