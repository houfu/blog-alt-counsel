# Research: SMU SOLID Project Announcement

**Research Date:** November 19, 2025
**Purpose:** Document official announcements about SMU's legal database project following Nov 18, 2025 event

## Summary

SMU Centre for Digital Law officially announced the **Singapore Open Legal Informatics Database (SOLID)** project with Ministry of Law support on November 18, 2025. Press release published same day as the launch event.

## Key Findings

### Project Name & Scope
**Singapore Open Legal Informatics Database (SOLID)**

**Data coverage:**
- Singapore court decisions (statistical information)
- Statutes
- Legal scholarship
- Court structures

**Key characteristic:** "Structured, research-ready data points that enable empirical analysis and technology development"

### Technical Approach

**Accessibility:**
- Public website
- REST API (Application Programming Interface)
- Open access principles
- Machine-readable datasets

**Focus:** Empirical legal research infrastructure (NOT just legal news aggregation like data.zeeker.sg)

### Timeline & Phases

**Duration:** 3 years

**Four phases:**
1. **Requirements gathering** - Stakeholder consultations
2. **Data collection and verification** - Semi-automated pipelines
3. **Publication** - Full documentation and API support
4. **Operationalisation** - Industry collaborations on use cases

**Milestones:**
- **Q4 2026:** Early iteration release
- **Q1 2028:** Full public launch (website, API, comprehensive documentation)

### Leadership

- **Principal Investigator:** Assistant Professor Jerrold Soh
- **Co-Investigator:** Assistant Professor Dirk Hartung
- **Team:** Research engineers and student assistants from SMU

### Intended Users

1. **Researchers** - Social scientific studies of Singapore's legal system
2. **Law firms and tech companies** - Building legal AI systems, analytics tools, innovations
3. **Policymakers** - Identifying systemic trends, evidence-based decisions
4. **Law schools** - Teaching legal data science and AI with Singapore-focused datasets
5. **International scholars** - Incorporating Singapore law in research and training datasets

### Additional Outputs

- Academic research papers
- Open-source code libraries for Singapore legal data
- Proof-of-concept applications (developed with industry and international partners)

## Comparison to data.zeeker.sg

### Overlap
- Both focus on legal data infrastructure for Singapore
- Both emphasize API access
- Both aim for open/public access

### Differences

| Aspect | data.zeeker.sg | SOLID |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| **Scope** | Legal news aggregation (40+ sources) | Empirical legal research (court decisions, statutes, scholarship, court structures) |
| **Data Type** | **Full-text content** (news articles, summaries, searchable text) | **Structured empirical data** (statistical datasets, metadata, quantitative metrics) |
| **Use Case** | Content search/reading, current awareness, "What did this article say?" | Statistical analysis, research, "How many cases of X type?" |
| **Query Examples** | "Find articles mentioning AI regulation" / "Read this judgment summary" | "Average case length in 2024" / "Employment case statistics" |
| **Timeline** | Already operational (2025) | Early release 2026, full launch 2028 |
| **Team** | Solo builder (1 person) | Institutional (PIs, research engineers, students, 3-year funding) |
| **Approach** | Scraping full text + RSS feeds, immediate deployment | Semi-automated pipelines for structured data extraction, phased stakeholder consultation |

### Complementary Aspects

**Critical distinction:** Different data types serving different needs - **full-text content vs. structured empirical data**

**How they complement each other:**
- SOLID identifies trends (quantitative) → data.zeeker.sg provides content to read (qualitative)
- Researcher uses SOLID to find "100 employment cases in 2024" → uses zeeker to read actual news coverage about those cases
- Both layers needed: structured metadata for analysis + full-text for understanding

**data.zeeker.sg strengths:**
- Already operational (2025)
- Full-text content (read actual articles, not just metadata)
- Current legal news coverage (daily updates)
- Fast iteration and experimentation
- Practical application layer (cookies.zeeker.sg proves concept)

**SOLID strengths:**
- Institutional sustainability (3-year funding, dedicated team)
- Comprehensive empirical data (court decisions, statutes, structured datasets)
- Stakeholder consultation process
- Ministry of Law backing
- Research rigor and documentation
- Focus on quantitative/statistical analysis

## Alt-Counsel Angle

**For resource-constrained practitioners:**
- SOLID targets researchers and legal AI developers (not day-to-day practitioner needs)
- data.zeeker.sg addresses different gap: accessible legal news aggregation
- Both projects validate that Singapore needs better legal data infrastructure
- Solo builders can prototype and prove concepts; institutions sustain and scale them

## Jurisdictional Context

✅ **Singapore-specific:** SOLID is focused entirely on Singapore legal data
✅ **Regional relevance:** Positions Singapore alongside leading jurisdictions (implied: US, UK, Australia with established legal data infrastructure)
🌍 **Global pattern:** Follows international trend of open legal data infrastructure

## Sources

**Primary Source:**
- [SMU to Build Open Legal Database with Support from Ministry of Law](https://news.smu.edu.sg/news/2025/11/18/smu-build-open-legal-database-support-ministry-law) - SMU Newsroom (Nov 18, 2024/2025 - date discrepancy noted)

**Additional Context:**
- SMU Centre for Digital Law website: https://cdl.smu.edu.sg/
- Centre launched Nov 26, 2024 (merger of Centre for Computational Law and Centre for AI and Data Governance)

## Notes for Part 3 Blog Post

**What this validates:**
- ✅ Institutional backing confirms legal data infrastructure matters for Singapore
- ✅ Different scope (empirical research vs. legal news) suggests complementary roles
- ✅ 2026-2028 timeline means data.zeeker.sg can continue exploring different aspects
- ✅ Both projects independently concluded Singapore needs better legal data infrastructure

**Honest assessment:**
- Cannot claim SOLID validates data.zeeker.sg specifically (different scope)
- CAN claim both arrived at same conclusion: Singapore needs legal data infrastructure
- CAN claim complementary strengths: solo builders prototype fast; institutions sustain long-term
- CAN claim data.zeeker.sg proved one person can build this with AI tools (feasibility)

**Framework application (from Part 1):**

1. **Assess overlap:** Significant overlap in vision (legal data infrastructure), different execution (news vs. empirical research)
2. **Identify gaps:** Legal news aggregation not covered by SOLID; application layer (like cookies.zeeker.sg) complementary
3. **Clarify motivation:** If this were business, might pivot; as labour of love, can continue exploring different angles while SOLID handles empirical research infrastructure
