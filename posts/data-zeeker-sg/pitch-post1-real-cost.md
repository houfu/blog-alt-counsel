# Pitch: Post 1 - "346 Articles Later: The Real Cost of Building data.zeeker.sg"

## Working Title
"346 Articles Later: Counting the Hours I'll Never Get Back"

## Core Argument
Everyone sees the finished product - a working legal database with 346 curated articles. Nobody sees the 250-350 hours of invisible labor. With the DNS renewal coming up, I'm asking myself: is this worth continuing? Here's what building "free public infrastructure" actually cost, and what else I could have done with that time.

## Target Audience
- Solo counsels weighing whether to build public tools
- Anyone who's thought "someone should build this"
- Developers considering open source/public good projects
- People who don't realize how much work "just" building a database involves

## Structure (800-1200 words)

### 1. The Finished Product (100-150 words)
Quick intro to what data.zeeker.sg is:
- Singapore's first public legal data API
- 346+ professionally curated legal articles
- Full-text search, SQL interface, REST API
- Completely free, open access

**Purpose:** Establish what we're talking about before breaking down the cost.

### 2. What 346 Articles Actually Means (300-400 words)
**The per-article work (×346):**
- Read full article: 5-10 min
- Analyze legal principles: 10-15 min
- Write professional summary: 10-20 min
- Structure metadata: 5 min
- **Subtotal: 30-45 min/article**

**Math:** 346 articles × 30-45 min = **173-260 hours** just on content curation

**Plus infrastructure:**
- Database design and setup: 20-30 hours
- Building data pipelines: 15-20 hours
- Setting up search/API: 10-15 hours
- Documentation: 5-10 hours
- **Subtotal: 50-75 hours**

**Plus ongoing:**
- Monitoring and maintenance
- Planning features that won't get built
- Mental overhead of "should update this"

**Grand total: 250-350 hours over 7 months**

**Purpose:** Make the invisible labor completely visible with concrete numbers.

### 3. The Opportunity Cost (300-400 words)
**What else could 250-350 hours have produced?**

**Option A: Revenue**
- Billable hours: $50K-100K+ at lawyer rates
- A paid product MVP
- Consulting projects
- Could have paid for multiple legal tech subscriptions instead of building free alternatives

**Option B: Other Projects**
- 50+ substantial blog posts
- 3-4 legal tech products
- Multiple automation tools
- Paid open source contributions

**Option C: Life**
- Not working evenings/weekends
- Family time
- Learning something new for fun
- Rest

**The realization:** I traded 250-350 hours for "Singapore's first public legal data API" - and I have no idea if anyone even uses it.

**Purpose:** Make the trade-off explicit and stark.

### 4. The Decision Point (200-250 words)
The DNS renewal is coming up. Do I continue?

**The question isn't:**
- Did it fail technically? (No, it works great)
- Is it valuable? (Yes, it fills a real gap)

**The question is:**
- Is this the best use of my next 250-350 hours?
- Should this be sustained by an individual or an institution?

The hard truth: **Important work ≠ work I should be doing**

**What happens next:**
- There's an SMU event on Nov 18 about building Singapore's legal database
- I need to understand what they're building
- Then decide: continue, hand off, or close?

For now, I'm documenting what it actually took to build this. Whether I continue or not, these lessons matter.

**Purpose:** Frame this as a decision point, not a done deal.

### 5. What I'd Tell Past Me (100-150 words)
**Before starting a public infrastructure project:**
1. Count the hours (really count them)
2. Multiply by your hourly rate
3. Ask: "Would I pay this much to have this exist?"
4. Ask: "What else could these hours build?"
5. Have an exit strategy from day one

**The lesson:** Your time is worth spending intentionally.

**Purpose:** Extractable wisdom for readers.

## Unique Angle
Most "I'm shutting down my project" posts are vague about the costs. This post **shows the receipts** - exact hours, exact trade-offs, exact opportunity cost.

It's not a failure story or a burnout story. It's an accounting exercise that shows why individual-built public infrastructure doesn't scale.

## Tone
- **Precise, not dramatic:** Just the numbers
- **Clear-eyed, not bitter:** Facts over feelings
- **Validating, not preachy:** Others will recognize themselves in this
- **Pragmatic:** This is math, not emotion

## Key Takeaway
Building public infrastructure as an individual means trading hundreds of hours for something you'll give away for free. Count those hours. Know what else they could build. Choose intentionally.

## What This Sets Up for Post 2
This post establishes:
- The work was real and substantial
- The cost is too high for individuals to sustain indefinitely
- There's a decision point coming

Post 2 (Technical Lessons) will document what worked and what didn't - useful whether I continue, hand off, or someone else builds similar infrastructure.

## Success Metrics
Post succeeds if:
- Readers can clearly visualize the 250-350 hours
- Someone considering a similar project does the math first
- Validates stopping as rational, not failure
- Makes invisible labor visible

## Potential Challenges
- **Sounds like complaining:** Mitigate by keeping it factual, numbers-focused
- **Readers feel guilty for using free resources:** Emphasize this is about structure, not users
- **Seems like asking for payment:** Be clear this isn't a fundraising appeal

## Key Phrase to Capture the Essence
"I spent 350 hours building something valuable. That's also 350 hours I didn't spend on everything else."
