# Research: SMU SOLID (Singapore Open Legal Informatics Database)

**Research Date:** November 20, 2025
**Event Date:** November 18, 2025
**Sources:** SMU Newsroom, OpenGov Asia

## Executive Summary

SMU Centre for Digital Law announced SOLID (Singapore Open Legal Informatics Database) on November 18, 2025. This is Singapore's first open empirical legal database focusing on **case law, statutes, legal scholarship, and court structures** for empirical research and legal AI development.

**Key Finding:** SOLID and data.zeeker.sg have **minimal overlap** - SOLID focuses on retrospective empirical data (case law analysis), while data.zeeker.sg focuses on current legal news aggregation. These are complementary, not competing projects.

## Project Details

### Scope and Data Content

SOLID will compile machine-readable datasets containing:
- **Singapore court decisions** (case law for empirical analysis)
- **Statutes** (legislative data)
- **Legal scholarship** (academic publications)
- **Court structures** (institutional data)

**What SOLID does NOT include:** Daily legal news, current awareness feeds, real-time legal updates

### Target Users

1. **Researchers**: Conducting social scientific studies of Singapore's legal system
2. **Law firms and tech companies**: Building and evaluating legal AI systems
3. **Policymakers**: Identifying systemic trends, evidence-based decision making
4. **Law schools**: Teaching legal data science and AI with Singapore-focused datasets
5. **International scholars and developers**: Global access to Singapore legal data

### Timeline

- **November 2025 - 2026**: Requirements gathering through stakeholder consultations
- **2026 - 2027**: Data collection and verification with semi-automated pipelines
- **4Q 2026**: Early database iteration release
- **2027 - 2028**: Publication with full documentation and API support
- **1Q 2028**: Full public launch (website, API, comprehensive documentation)

### Technical Infrastructure

- **Public website** for browsing and exploration
- **Application Programming Interface (API)** for programmatic access
- **Machine-readable, structured data** specifically prepared for computational analysis
- **Full documentation and support** for developers and researchers

### Team Structure

- **Principal Investigator**: Assistant Professor Jerrold Soh
- **Co-Investigator**: Assistant Professor Dirk Hartung
- **Support team**: Research engineers and student assistants from SMU
- **Duration**: Three-year project (2025-2028)

### Funding and Support

- Supported by Singapore's **Ministry of Law** (MinLaw)
- Partnership model with stakeholder consultations
- Industry collaborations planned for operationalization phase

## Philosophical Approach

### SOLID's Vision: Legal Scholars & Social Scientists

**Quote from Asst Prof Jerrold Soh:**
> "Singapore's legal system is internationally recognised for its openness and digital maturity, but home-grown computational research and tools focused on Singapore law remain limited."

**Quote from Prof Daniel Martin Katz (external expert):**
> "High-quality structured data remains hard to come by in the legal domain."

**Focus areas:**
- Empirical legal research
- Computational legal studies
- Legal AI training and evaluation
- Evidence-based policymaking
- Academic legal data science

### data.zeeker.sg's Vision: GenAI & Current Awareness

**Focus areas:**
- Daily legal news aggregation
- Current awareness (what's happening now)
- Curated resources for GenAI training
- Free-text legal content
- Real-time legal updates

## Comparison: SOLID vs data.zeeker.sg

| Dimension | SOLID | data.zeeker.sg |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Empirical research | Current awareness |
| **Data Type** | Case law, statutes, scholarship | Legal news articles |
| **Temporal Scope** | Retrospective analysis | Real-time daily updates |
| **Primary Users** | Researchers, academics | Developers, practitioners, GenAI builders |
| **Use Cases** | Statistical analysis, legal AI training | Daily summaries, news aggregation, chatbots |
| **Timeline** | 4Q 2026 - 1Q 2028 | Operational since 2024 |
| **Team** | Institutional (professors, research engineers) | Solo builder |
| **Funding** | Ministry of Law | Self-funded |

## Overlap Assessment

### Minimal Direct Overlap

**Different data sources:**
- SOLID: Case law, statutes, scholarship (authoritative legal texts)
- data.zeeker.sg: Legal news from 40+ sources (journalistic coverage)

**Different temporal focus:**
- SOLID: Historical/retrospective (enabling empirical studies over time)
- data.zeeker.sg: Current/prospective (what's happening this week)

**Different use cases:**
- SOLID: "How many employment discrimination cases were decided 2015-2025?"
- data.zeeker.sg: "What legal news happened today? Summarize for me."

### Complementary Relationship

**Potential synergies:**
1. SOLID provides empirical case law → data.zeeker.sg could link news articles to relevant cases
2. data.zeeker.sg identifies trending topics → SOLID enables historical analysis of those topics
3. Both serve legal AI ecosystem but different parts (training data vs. current awareness)

## Key Insights for Part 3

### What This Means for data.zeeker.sg's Decision

**Good news:**
- ✅ SOLID validates that structured legal data infrastructure matters
- ✅ Minimal overlap means not duplicating effort
- ✅ Complementary scopes suggest room for both projects
- ✅ data.zeeker.sg already operational while SOLID won't launch until 2026-2028

**Considerations:**
- ⚠️ SOLID has institutional backing data.zeeker.sg lacks
- ⚠️ SOLID addresses a gap (empirical research) that data.zeeker.sg doesn't fill
- ⚠️ data.zeeker.sg fills a gap (daily legal news) that SOLID doesn't address
- ⚠️ Different philosophical approaches: scholarly vs. builder-focused

### Philosophical Differences (User's Insight)

**User's observation:**
> "I think there is a philosophical difference. I am interested in what to feed my genAI machine, so I curate resources and free text, whereas SOLID looks at what a legal scholar or social scientist is interested in."

**Analysis:**
- **SOLID**: Academic/research paradigm → structured empirical data for statistical analysis
- **data.zeeker.sg**: Builder/practitioner paradigm → curated content for AI applications

**User's note:**
> "SMU is still developing the vision, so this is a work in progress, let's see what happens."

## Additional Context

### User's Decision Factors

1. **Domain renewal**: User decided to renew the domain
2. **Reasoning**: "I realised I'm not done with zeeker's visions, so that's good enough reason to renew in my book"
3. **Mastodon feedback**: Community member advised:
   - "Announce and market your project. Get users, get feedback. Fail fast and fail often."
   - "Don't be trapped in the dream that if you build it perfectly, they will come"
   - "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. Get a team"

### Key Quotes to Reference

**From SOLID announcement:**
- "Singapore's first open empirical legal database"
- "Freely accessible to researchers worldwide"
- "Machine-readable datasets containing key statistical information"

**Philosophical difference:**
- SOLID → What legal scholars need (empirical case analysis)
- data.zeeker.sg → What GenAI builders need (curated current content)

## Next Steps for Part 3

1. Frame SOLID announcement as validation (institutions investing = work matters)
2. Clarify philosophical difference (scholar vs. builder paradigm)
3. Assess overlap honestly (minimal - different scopes and use cases)
4. Discuss renewal decision incorporating:
   - SOLID as validation, not competition
   - Mastodon feedback about marketing and building teams
   - User's realization: "not done with zeeker's visions"
5. Reference Part 1's framework (assess overlap, identify gaps, clarify motivation)
6. Conclude with what's next for data.zeeker.sg given this new context
