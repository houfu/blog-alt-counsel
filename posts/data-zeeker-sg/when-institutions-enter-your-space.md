My domain renewal invoice will arrive soon. Another two years of data.zeeker.sg: $110.

That's not the real cost. And the renewal isn't really the question.

I've carried a vision for years: build structured legal data infrastructure for Singapore, create apps on top of it, eventually something bigger. Not just tools—rethink what's possible when legal data is actually accessible and machine-readable.

data.zeeker.sg was my closest attempt. Over 150 hours across several months building Singapore's first public API for legal news. I built the data pipeline, collected 346 articles, proved the technical stack works. Built one app on top—cookies.zeeker.sg, which summarizes Singapore Law Watch headlines. It works.

Then SMU Centre for Digital Law announced they're launching a legal database project. November 18, 2025. Hiring a full-time Research Engineer and Research Assistant for 3 years. Building "Singapore's first open empirical legal database."

Institutional resources doing what I tried to do solo.

The pragmatic voice in my head says: Stop. Zero known users. Institutions can do this better. Cut your losses.

But I'm still in love with this vision.

## What This Project Means to Me

This isn't just about data.zeeker.sg. It's about the full stack.

The zeeker suite: structured legal data as foundation, then apps that actually use it. Right now, two pieces exist. data.zeeker.sg—a legal news database with public API, structured data, CC-BY-4.0 licensing. And cookies.zeeker.sg—a working app that summarizes legal news headlines.

The broader vision includes more. A chatbot. An MCP server for Claude Code integration. More data sources—not just legal news, but judgments, legislation, regulatory notices. Eventually: AI-powered legal services. Maybe even rethink what a law firm could be if it's built on this kind of infrastructure.

But I kept thinking "needs more resources before it's ready to announce."

So I built but never really announced it. Minimal user acquisition effort. Zero known users.

cookies.zeeker.sg had narrower scope—just summarize headlines—so I announced that one. But the data layer? Still waiting for it to feel "complete enough."

Now renewal forces the question: If I'm not willing to announce it, why am I maintaining it?

## Why I Built This

Singapore's legal information exists, but it's scattered. HTML pages across 40+ sources. PDFs behind paywalls. No programmatic access. You can browse it, but you can't build with it.

I wanted to see if one person could create infrastructure that used to require teams. GenAI made it feasible—Claude helped me build the data pipeline, the API, the search functionality. 150+ hours across several months, mostly evenings and weekends while practicing law full-time.

I proved it's possible. You can build this solo now.

But possible doesn't mean needed. I never really validated demand. I built first, hoped to validate later. Kept waiting for the project to feel "complete enough" to announce.

The fuller vision kept pulling me forward. Not just legal news—all legal data types. Not just data—apps that use it. Not just apps—maybe a whole new model for legal services.

But I'm a practicing lawyer who codes on the side. The vision is years ahead of my execution capacity.

## Then SMU Announced Their Project

November 18, 2025. SMU Centre for Digital Law is launching their legal database project. Hiring full-time staff for 3 years. "Singapore's first open empirical legal database."

I don't know what they're actually building yet. Their scope, their approach, their technical infrastructure—all unknown until the event.

But institutional resources doing what I tried to do solo changes the equation.

## The Two Voices

The pragmatic voice:
- 150+ hours with zero known users
- Never validated demand, never announced properly
- SMU has institutional backing, multi-year timeline, dedicated staff
- The vision was always aspirational—tech-enabled law firm while practicing full-time?
- You proved it's technically feasible, that's enough
- Time to let it go

The passion project voice:
- I'm still in love with this vision
- This is labour of love, not my day job—different success criteria
- "Zero users" might just mean poor distribution, not bad vision
- Institutions existing doesn't automatically mean quit
- I could pivot—focus on apps while they handle data infrastructure
- Or complementary work—different data sources, different audiences
- 150 hours is sunk cost, but the infrastructure exists and works

I don't know which voice is right.

## How I'm Thinking Through This

I need information before I can decide. Specifically, I need to understand what SMU is actually building.

**Assess overlap:** What's their scope? Legal news like mine, or case law and empirical research? Who's their audience—researchers, developers, practitioners? What's their technical infrastructure—APIs, bulk downloads, just a website?

Until I know their scope, I can't know if we're building the same thing or something adjacent.

**Identify gaps:** Even if overlap exists, gaps might remain. Maybe they're comprehensive and I can be experimental. Maybe they target researchers and I target developers. Maybe they handle data and I focus on the apps layer. Or maybe complete overlap and I gracefully hand off.

**Clarify motivation:** This is the hardest question. What am I actually trying to achieve?

## The Motivation Question

If this were a business, the answer would be clear. Zero users means stop or pivot. Institutions with more resources mean competitive threat. Find product-market fit or shut down.

But this is labour of love. I practice law for income. I build this because I want to see if it's possible, because I think Singapore needs it, because I'm still in love with the vision.

That changes what "should I continue?" means.

When I'm honest with myself: I don't know if anyone wants structured legal data APIs for Singapore. I never validated demand. GenAI made building feasible, but feasible doesn't mean needed.

Am I building this because:
- **Singapore needs it?** If SMU provides it, maybe my work is done. Mission accomplished, even if it wasn't my infrastructure that succeeded.
- **I need it for my practice?** Then building for myself is enough. User count doesn't matter.
- **I want to prove I can?** Already proved it. One person can build this now.
- **I'm still exploring what's possible?** Then continue makes sense, regardless of users or institutions.

I think it's the last one. I'm exploring. But I'm not sure.

And there's an uncomfortable question underneath: Is this about the vision or is this about ego? Do I love the possibility of what could be built, or do I love the idea of being the one who built it?

If SMU builds exactly what I envisioned and does it well, will I be satisfied that the vision succeeded? Or will I be disappointed it wasn't mine?

I don't have a good answer yet.

## I Don't Know Yet

I'm attending the SMU Centre for Digital Law event on November 18. After that, I'll have information to actually decide.

Possible outcomes:
- **Continue as-is** if gaps exist and I can fill them
- **Modify approach** if overlap exists but complementary role possible
- **Collaborate** if they want the infrastructure I built
- **Hand off gracefully** if they're building what I envisioned
- **Stop** if complete overlap makes continuation redundant

The domain renewal isn't until December. I have time.

What I know now: The question isn't about $110. It's about what I'm trying to achieve with this vision I've carried for years, and whether I'm building for the right reasons.

For other solo builders facing similar moments: when institutions enter your space, you'll face the same voices. Pragmatism says cut losses. Passion says keep going. The decision depends on what gaps remain and what you're actually trying to achieve.

But maybe the hardest part is being honest about whether you love the vision or just love being the builder.

I'm still working that out.
