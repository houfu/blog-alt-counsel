My domain renewal invoice will arrive soon. Another two years of data.zeeker.sg: $110.

That's not the real cost. And the renewal isn't really the question.

I've carried a vision for years: build structured legal data infrastructure for Singapore, create apps on top of it, eventually something bigger. Not just tools—rethink what's possible when legal data is actually accessible and machine-readable.

data.zeeker.sg was my closest attempt. Over 150 hours across several months building Singapore's first public API for legal news. I built the data pipeline, collected 346 articles, proved the technical stack works. Built one app on top—cookies.zeeker.sg, which summarizes Singapore Law Watch headlines. It works.

Then SMU Centre for Digital Law announced they're launching a legal database project. November 18, 2025. Hiring a full-time Research Engineer and Research Assistant for 3 years. Building "Singapore's first open empirical legal database."

Institutional resources doing what I tried to do solo.

The pragmatic voice in my head says: Stop. Zero known users. Institutions can do this better. Cut your losses.

But I'm still in love with this vision.

## The Vision I've Been Chasing

This isn't just about data.zeeker.sg. It's about the full stack.

The zeeker suite: structured legal data as foundation, then apps that actually use it. Right now, two pieces exist:
- **data.zeeker.sg**: Legal news database with public API, structured data, CC-BY-4.0 licensing
- **cookies.zeeker.sg**: Working app that summarizes legal news headlines

The broader vision includes a chatbot, an MCP server, more data sources. Eventually: AI-powered legal services. Maybe even rethink what a law firm could be if it's built on this kind of infrastructure.

But data.zeeker.sg—the foundation—feels incomplete. I built the pipeline and one database (legal news with 346 articles). I envisioned a collection of databases: legal news, judgments, legislation, regulatory notices. I kept thinking "needs more resources before it's ready to announce."

So I built but never really announced it. Minimal user acquisition effort. Zero known users.

cookies.zeeker.sg had narrower scope—just summarize headlines—so I announced that one. But the data layer? Still waiting for it to feel "complete enough."

Now renewal forces the question: If I'm not willing to announce it, why am I maintaining it?

## When Institutions Show Up

Then SMU's announcement arrived.

This changes everything—or maybe it changes nothing. I won't know until their November 18 event.

Because here's what I need to understand:

**What are they actually building?**
- Is it the same scope (legal news, public APIs, structured data)?
- Or different focus (case law, empirical research, academic datasets)?
- Who's their audience—researchers? Developers? General public?

**What gaps remain?**
- If they're building what I built: Can I pivot? Focus on the apps layer while they handle data infrastructure?
- If they're building something different: Is there complementary work? Different audiences?
- Or complete overlap, making my work redundant?

**What does "success" mean for me?**
- This is labour of love, not my day job
- I'm a practicing lawyer who codes on the side
- Different success criteria than startups needing ROI/users/revenue

That last point matters. Passion projects don't follow startup logic.

## The Framework: Continue vs. Stop

When institutions enter your passion project space, here's how to think through it:

### 1. Assess Overlap

Don't assume complete overlap without evidence.

I'm attending SMU's event November 18 to find out:
- Their actual scope and approach
- Their timeline and deliverables
- Their technical infrastructure and access model

Until then, I can't know if they're building the same thing or something adjacent.

### 2. Identify Remaining Gaps

Even if there's overlap, gaps might exist:

**If same scope:**
- Can you modify approach? (Solo agility vs. institutional comprehensiveness)
- Different audience? (Developers vs. researchers)
- Complementary role? (I focus on apps, they focus on data)

**If different scope:**
- What did they not build that you envisioned?
- Is that gap still worth filling?
- Can you focus on the remaining gap?

**For me specifically:**
- Maybe they're doing case law, I'm doing legal news
- Maybe they need comprehensive coverage, I can do experimental/niche datasets
- Maybe they're building for researchers, I'm building for developers/practitioners

Or maybe complete overlap, and I gracefully shut down.

### 3. Clarify Your Motivation

This is the crucial question.

**If this is a business:**
- Needs users, revenue, product-market fit
- "Zero users" is strong signal to stop or pivot
- Institutions with more resources = competitive threat

**If this is a passion project:**
- Success looks different
- "Zero users" might just mean poor distribution, not bad vision
- Institutions existing doesn't automatically mean quit
- You're optimizing for different outcomes (learning, exploration, personal satisfaction)

**For me:** This is labour of love. I practice law for income. I build this because I want to see if it's possible, because I think Singapore needs it, because I'm still in love with the vision.

That changes what "should I continue?" means.

## The Honest Question

What am I actually trying to achieve?

When I'm honest: I don't know if anyone wants structured legal data APIs for Singapore. I never really validated demand—I built first, hoped to validate later. Minimal user acquisition, no announcement, just... built and waited.

GenAI made building feasible. I could create infrastructure that used to require teams. But feasible doesn't mean needed.

Pragmatism says:
- 150+ hours with zero known users
- SMU has institutional backing
- The vision was always aspirational (tech-enabled law firm while practicing full-time?)
- Time to let it go

But passion projects don't follow those rules—or do they?

If this is truly labour of love, then "zero users" and "institutions exist" don't automatically mean stop. They mean: clarify what success actually looks like for you.

Am I building this because:
- Singapore needs it? (If SMU provides it, my work is done)
- I need it for my practice? (Then building for myself is enough)
- I want to prove I can? (Already proved it)
- I'm still exploring what's possible? (Then continue makes sense)

I won't know until I attend SMU's event. But the framework helps: understand what they're building, see where gaps remain, then decide based on what I'm actually trying to achieve.

## What Happens Next

I'm attending the SMU Centre for Digital Law event on November 18.

After that, I'll have information to actually decide:
- **Continue as-is** - if gaps exist and I can fill them
- **Modify approach** - if overlap exists but complementary role possible
- **Hand off or collaborate** - if they want the infrastructure I built
- **Shut down gracefully** - if complete overlap makes continuation redundant

The domain renewal isn't until December. I have time.

What I know now: The question isn't about $110. It's about what I'm trying to achieve with this vision I've carried for years, and whether institutional approaches change that.

For other solo builders: when institutions enter your space, don't assume you should automatically quit. But do get clear on what you're actually trying to achieve. That clarity makes the decision much easier.
