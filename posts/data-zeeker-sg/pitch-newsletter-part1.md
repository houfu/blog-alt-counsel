# Pitch: Newsletter - "I'm Still in Love With a Project Nobody Wants"

I'm still in love with a project nobody wants. For years I've envisioned building the full stack - structured legal data, apps on top, AI assistant, eventually a tech-enabled law firm. data.zeeker.sg was my closest attempt: 150+ hours, Singapore's first public legal news API, working infrastructure. Zero known users. Then SMU announced they're building legal data infrastructure with real resources. My domain renewal ($110) arrives in December. The pragmatic side screams stop - zero validation, institutions can do it better, cut your losses. But I'm still in love with this vision. It's my labour of love, not my day job, so different success criteria apply. The question isn't really about $110 renewal - it's whether I finally let go of a vision I've loved for years when pragmatism says nobody wants it, or whether passion projects don't follow those rules. I'm attending SMU's event Nov 18 to understand what they're building, then deciding. This newsletter explores what I'm working through, and I'd love to hear: have you faced this? How did you decide?
