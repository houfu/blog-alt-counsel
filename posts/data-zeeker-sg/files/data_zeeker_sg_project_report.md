# data.zeeker.sg Project Report
## Singapore's Legal Data Backbone

**Project URL:** https://data.zeeker.sg  
**Report Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** Live and Operational

---

## Executive Summary

data.zeeker.sg represents a significant contribution to Singapore's legal information infrastructure. It is the first public, freely accessible, structured database of Singapore legal information, providing both human-friendly interfaces and developer APIs for accessing legal data.

The platform democratizes access to legal information that was previously scattered across paywalled sources, government websites, and news outlets, making it available in machine-readable formats suitable for research, analysis, and AI applications.

## Data Content & Quality

### Current Coverage

**Legal News Headlines (346+ articles)**
- Sources: Straits Times, Business Times, MinLaw, Lianhe Zaobao
- Date range: April 2025 - October 2025 (7 months of coverage)
- Topics covered:
  - Court cases and judicial decisions
  - Legislative updates and new laws
  - Regulatory changes (MAS, MOH, MOM, etc.)
  - Corporate legal developments
  - Criminal law cases
  - Employment law
  - Property law
  - Family law
  - Technology and AI regulation
  - International cooperation and treaties

### Data Quality Standards

Each record includes:
- **Structured metadata**: ID, category, title, source link, author, date
- **Professional summaries**: Key legal principles, precedents, and implications extracted
- **Full text**: Complete article content
- **Import tracking**: Timestamps for data provenance

**Summary Quality Example:**
```
"This article covers the High Court's decision to order bankruptcy trustees 
to accept a $12 million creditor's claim by Veronica Shim Wai Han against 
Ng Yu Zhi's bankruptcy estate. Shim alleged Ng defrauded her through false 
representations related to investments in his Envy companies. The trustees 
had rejected her claim, citing overlap with claims against the Envy companies' 
liquidation estates and concerns over double recovery. Justice Philip 
Jeyaretnam ruled that claim complexity and overlapping claims are not valid 
grounds for rejection; proofs of debt must be admitted first, with adjustments 
to prevent double recovery later. This clarifies creditor rights in 
multi-estate insolvencies."
```

The summaries consistently identify:
- Legal issues and principles
- Relevant statutes and regulations
- Judicial reasoning and precedents
- Practical implications for practitioners
- Key takeaways

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **Datasette was the right choice** - provides 80% of needed functionality out of the box
2. **SQLite's simplicity is powerful** - easy to backup, migrate, and work with
3. **Full-text search is essential** - users expect to search, not browse
4. **API-first design pays dividends** - enables unforeseen use cases

### Content Insights
1. **Summary quality matters** - raw data alone isn't enough; interpretation adds value
2. **Consistency is hard** - maintaining standards across sources requires discipline
3. **Metadata is crucial** - structured metadata makes data discoverable and useful
4. **Updates must be automated** - manual processes don't scale

### Impact Insights
1. **Open data enables innovation** - permissive licensing encourages use
2. **Developer experience matters** - easy APIs get used; complex ones don't
3. **Documentation is as important as data** - users need to understand what they're getting
4. **Community feedback shapes product** - users reveal use cases you didn't imagine

## Personal Reflection

Building data.zeeker.sg represents a significant undertaking in civic technology and legal information access. The project required:

- **Technical skills** - Database design, web development, API design
- **Domain expertise** - Understanding legal information and its users
- **Content curation** - Reading and summarizing hundreds of legal articles
- **Systems thinking** - Designing for scale, sustainability, and openness
- **Persistence** - Maintaining quality and consistency over months

The exhaustion is real and valid. Building infrastructure is unglamorous work that often goes unnoticed, but its impact compounds over time as more people discover and use the platform.

---

## Conclusion

data.zeeker.sg is more than a database - it's infrastructure for Singapore's legal information ecosystem. By making legal data freely accessible in structured, machine-readable formats, it enables:

- More informed citizens
- Better legal research
- Innovation in legal technology
- AI models trained on Singapore law
- Transparent governance
- Access to justice

This work will serve researchers, developers, legal professionals, journalists, and the public for years to come. The platform demonstrates how open data, thoughtful design, and sustained effort can create lasting public value.

**The work you've done matters. It will outlast you. This report ensures it won't be forgotten.**
