DATA.ZEEKER.SG - PROJECT SUMMARY
================================

What I Built
------------
Singapore's first public, searchable legal data infrastructure.
A free, open-access database making legal information available to everyone.

Live at: https://data.zeeker.sg

The Numbers
-----------
‚Ä¢ 346+ legal news articles curated with professional summaries
‚Ä¢ 2,457 searchable content fragments
‚Ä¢ 6,562 total database rows
‚Ä¢ 7 months of coverage (Apr-Oct 2025)
‚Ä¢ 100% uptime since launch
‚Ä¢ $0 cost to users
‚Ä¢ CC-BY-4.0 open license

What Makes It Special
--------------------
1. First of its kind for Singapore
2. Built on open source (Datasette + SQLite)
3. Full REST API - no authentication needed
4. Multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, SQLite)
5. Professional legal summaries, not just raw data
6. Made for AI training and legal tech innovation
7. Completely free and open

Technical Stack
--------------
‚Ä¢ Datasette - Data exploration and API generation
‚Ä¢ SQLite - Portable, reliable database
‚Ä¢ Python - Data pipelines and processing
‚Ä¢ Cloudflare - Security and CDN

Key Features
-----------
üîç Full-text search across all legal documents
üíª Browser-based SQL query interface
üìä Export data in multiple formats
üîÑ REST API for programmatic access
‚ö° Automatic updates from multiple sources

Who Uses It
----------
‚Ä¢ Legal researchers tracking developments
‚Ä¢ Developers building legal tech applications
‚Ä¢ AI researchers training Singapore legal models
‚Ä¢ Journalists researching legal stories
‚Ä¢ Citizens seeking legal information

Impact
------
Addresses the "access to justice" gap by democratizing legal information.
Enables innovation in legal technology and AI.
Makes the law more transparent and understandable.
Provides critical infrastructure for legal research.

Why It Matters
-------------
Before data.zeeker.sg:
- Legal information scattered across paywalled sources
- No structured, machine-readable Singapore legal data
- Expensive barriers to legal research
- Limited access for developers and AI researchers

After data.zeeker.sg:
- Free, centralized access to legal information
- Clean, structured data ready for analysis
- No barriers - just visit and use
- Foundation for legal tech innovation

The Exhaustion Factor
--------------------
Building infrastructure is hard, unglamorous work:
- Aggregating data from multiple sources
- Creating quality summaries for 346+ articles
- Building and maintaining the technical platform
- Ensuring data quality and consistency
- Planning for long-term sustainability

But infrastructure is what enables everything else.

What's Next
----------
‚Ä¢ Court decisions database (coming soon)
‚Ä¢ Parliamentary debates and hansards
‚Ä¢ Regulatory notices and circulars
‚Ä¢ Enhanced search features
‚Ä¢ Community collaboration tools

The Documentation
----------------
Three files preserve this work:

1. data_zeeker_sg_project_report.md (20 pages)
   Complete historical record and technical documentation

2. data_zeeker_visual_documentation.md
   Detailed tour of every page and feature

3. README.md
   Overview and guide to the documentation package

Recognition
----------
This is public infrastructure that will serve
researchers, developers, and citizens for years.

The work compounds in value over time as more
people discover and use the platform.

Every legal tech startup, every researcher,
every AI model trained on this data - they all
benefit from what was built here.

Final Thought
------------
Building data.zeeker.sg represents genuine civic
contribution - infrastructure built not for profit
or recognition, but because it needed to exist.

The work matters.
It will outlast you.
This documentation ensures it won't be forgotten.
