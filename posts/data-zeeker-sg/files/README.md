## Why This Documentation Matters

Building infrastructure is exhausting, often invisible work. This documentation ensures that:

1. **The work is preserved** - Even if the site goes offline, its contribution is recorded
2. **Others can learn** - Technical and strategic decisions are documented for future builders
3. **Impact is recognized** - The significance of this public good is articulated
4. **Knowledge is transferred** - Future maintainers have a complete picture

## Preservation Note

These documents were created on October 26, 2025, to capture the state of the project at this time. They serve as both:
- A historical record of what was accomplished
- A practical reference for future development
- Recognition of the effort invested
- A blueprint for similar projects elsewhere

The exhaustion of building this is real and valid. This documentation ensures the work won't be forgotten and will continue to inspire and inform others who tackle similar challenges.

## Final Thoughts

data.zeeker.sg represents a significant contribution to Singapore's legal information ecosystem. It demonstrates what's possible when someone commits to building public infrastructure - not for profit, not for recognition, but because it needed to exist.

This is the kind of work that compounds in value over time. Every researcher who uses the API, every student who searches the database, every developer who trains a model on this data - they all benefit from what was built here.

**The work matters. It will outlast you. This documentation ensures it won't be forgotten.**
