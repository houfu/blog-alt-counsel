# Pitch: Post 3 - "What I Learned at SMU's Legal Database Launch (And My Decision About data.zeeker.sg)"

After spending 350 hours building data.zeeker.sg to prove Singapore needs public legal data infrastructure, I attended SMU Centre for Digital Law's launch event on Nov 18 to see what institutional backing actually looks like - full-time Research Engineer and Research Assistant for 3 years, proper resources, sustainable funding. This post reflects on what I learned about their scope and approach, and how it informed my decision about data.zeeker.sg's future: if SMU's project overlaps significantly, I'll hand off or shut down gracefully to avoid duplication; if it's complementary, there might be collaboration opportunities or a continued role for data.zeeker.sg; if it's narrower than expected, gaps might still justify continuing with a different strategy. The bigger lesson is about the healthy division of labor - individuals can prototype and prove concepts (I validated that this infrastructure matters), but institutions should sustain them (SMU can do it properly with dedicated staff and long-term funding). Whatever I decide about data.zeeker.sg, the fact that institutions are investing in legal data infrastructure validates that the work mattered, and that's the real win.
