# Pitch: Post 3 - "What I Learned at SMU's Legal Database Launch (And My Decision About data.zeeker.sg)"

After 150+ hours building data.zeeker.sg, I attended SMU Centre for Digital Law's launch event on Nov 18 to see institutional legal data infrastructure in action. I met with the project leader, we discussed their scope and approach, and I applied the framework from Part 1: assess overlap (what are they actually building?), identify gaps (where can solo builders still contribute?), clarify motivation (why am I really doing this?). The assessment: SMU's focusing on empirical legal research with dedicated staff and 3-year funding—significant overlap in vision, but different execution and scope. The conversation revealed complementary strengths: institutions sustain infrastructure over time; solo builders iterate fast and experiment freely. My decision: I'm renewing the domain and continuing. The honest reason is simple—I'm not done exploring this vision. A community member told me "if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together." Both matter. This post reflects on what I learned at the event, what surprised me about institutional vs. solo approaches, and the bigger lesson: individuals prototype to prove concepts are feasible; institutions consolidate and sustain them. I proved one person can build this infrastructure with AI tools. SMU's proving institutions can sustain it properly. Now I get to keep building and see what emerges.
