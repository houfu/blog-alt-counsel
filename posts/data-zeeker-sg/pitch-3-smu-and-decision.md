# Pitch: Post 3 - "What I Learned at SMU's Legal Database Launch (And My Decision About data.zeeker.sg)"

After spending over 150 hours building data.zeeker.sg, I attended SMU Centre for Digital Law's SOLID launch on Nov 18 to see what institutional backing looks like - two professors, research engineers, Ministry of Law support, 3-year timeline. Part 1 laid out my framework: assess overlap, identify gaps, clarify motivation. Here's what I learned: SOLID focuses on case law, statutes, and legal scholarship for empirical research (what legal scholars want), while data.zeeker.sg aggregates daily legal news for current awareness (what GenAI builders want). Different data, different use cases, different paradigms - minimal overlap, actually complementary. The real validation isn't that we're building the same thing (we're not), but that multiple people believe open legal data infrastructure matters enough to invest time and resources. Someone on Mastodon told me: "Announce and market your project. Get users, get feedback. Fail fast. Don't wait for perfect." They were right - I've been waiting for "complete enough" while SOLID won't even launch until 2026. My domain renewal arrived. I paid it. I realized I'm not done with zeeker's visions - this was always about the full stack (data → apps → AI services → maybe rethink what a law firm could be). SOLID's existence validates that open data work matters. Different approaches can coexist - institutional research infrastructure and solo builder experiments both have roles to play. The decision isn't about stepping aside for institutions to take over - it's about finally announcing what I built and seeing who else believes this matters.
