excerpt: "After 150+ hours building data.zeeker.sg, I attended SMU's SOLID database launch to see institutional legal data infrastructure in action. I met with the project leader, applied my decision framework, and made my choice: I'm continuing. Here's what I learned about when solo builders should persist alongside institutions."

My domain renewal invoice arrived last week. Another two years of zeeker.sg: $110.

In [Part 1](../when-institutions-enter-your-space/), I laid out the tension: I'd spent 150+ hours building data.zeeker.sg while working full-time as a lawyer. Zero known users. Then SMU Centre for Digital Law announced they're building legal data infrastructure with institutional resources—dedicated staff, 3-year funding, Ministry of Law backing.

Should I continue or stop?

I didn't have the answer then. I said I'd attend their November 18 launch event first, apply my three-question framework, then decide.

Yesterday, I attended. Today, I have my answer.

**I'm renewing the domain. I'm continuing.**

This post walks through what I learned at SMU's event, how I applied the decision framework from Part 1, and what this taught me about when solo builders should persist alongside institutions.

## What SMU Actually Announced

The event was at SMU's Yong Pung How School of Law. Roundtable discussions with local stakeholders and international experts. The announcement: **Singapore Open Legal Informatics Database (SOLID)**.

**Scope:** Machine-readable datasets with statistical information about Singapore court decisions, statutes, and legal scholarship—not full-text content. Structured empirical data for research.

**Timeline:** 3-year project. Early iteration Q4 2026, full public launch Q1 2028.

**Team:** Led by Assistant Professors Jerrold Soh and Dirk Hartung, with research engineers and student assistants.

**Backing:** Ministry of Law support, institutional resources.

**Target users:** Researchers, law firms building legal AI, policymakers, law schools.

Sitting in that room, listening to the vision—I felt validation, not competition.

## Applying the Framework: Three Questions

In Part 1, I outlined three questions for deciding whether to continue when institutions enter your space:

1. **Assess the overlap** - What are they actually building?
2. **Identify remaining gaps** - Where can solo builders still contribute?
3. **Clarify your motivation** - Why am I really doing this?

Let me walk through each.

### 1. Assess the Overlap: What Are They Building vs. What I'm Building?

**The assessment:** Significant overlap in vision. Different execution and scope.

Both projects believe Singapore needs better legal data infrastructure. Both want open access with APIs. But here's the critical difference:

**SOLID focuses on structured empirical data** for research—statistical datasets, metadata about court decisions, quantitative information.

Example SOLID queries:
- "How many employment cases were filed in 2024?"
- "What's the average case length in the High Court?"

**data.zeeker.sg provides full-text content**—actual news articles, searchable summaries, readable text.

Example data.zeeker.sg queries:
- "Find articles mentioning AI regulation"
- "What did this judgment say about employment contracts?"

The difference: **"How many?"** (quantitative research) vs. **"What did it say?"** (qualitative content access).

**Why both matter:** A researcher might use SOLID to identify 100 employment cases in 2024, then use data.zeeker.sg to read news coverage and understand the narrative. Different data types. Complementary use cases.

**The complementary strengths:**

SOLID has institutional sustainability—3-year funding, dedicated staff, proper research methodology, stakeholder consultations. They'll do empirical research infrastructure right.

I can iterate fast and experiment freely. Built data.zeeker.sg in months working evenings and weekends. I can try things, fail quickly, pivot without committee approval while SOLID builds the empirical research foundation properly.

We're not competing. We're building different layers of the same vision.

### 2. Identify the Gaps: What's Still Missing?

Meeting with the project leader clarified this further.

Legal news is scattered across 40+ sources—Singapore Law Watch, Law Gazette, legal blogs, firm newsletters, government announcements. No centralized database. No API.

SOLID covers court decisions, statutes, and legal scholarship (structured empirical data). It doesn't cover daily legal news aggregation or full-text content.

data.zeeker.sg fills that gap. It's operational now. SOLID launches its early iteration Q4 2026—over a year away.

### 3. Clarify My Motivation: Why Am I Really Doing This?

This was the hardest question in Part 1. It remains the most important.

If data.zeeker.sg were a business, the answer would be clear. Zero known users means stop or pivot hard. Institutions with more resources mean competitive threat. Find product-market fit or shut down.

But this is labour of love. Different success criteria.

A community member gave me advice before the event:

> "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. Get a team."

They were pushing me toward the institutional path. And they're right about sustainability.

But here's what I realized sitting at that SMU event, watching institutional backing in action:

**I'm not done exploring this vision.**

That's the honest reason. Not because I proved demand (I didn't—zero users). Not because SMU validated my specific approach (they're building something different). Not because this will become a business (it won't).

Because I'm still in love with the vision of what legal data infrastructure could enable. Because I proved one person can build this with AI tools. Because there's more to explore at the application layer while institutions handle sustainability.

The real question for passion projects isn't "is this viable?" It's "am I done?"

I'm not done.

## What Surprised Me

Going into the event, I expected to feel discouraged. Institutions doing what I tried to do solo—that should trigger "hand it off and move on," right?

Instead, I felt energized.

**Three things surprised me:**

**1. How much room there is for experimentation**

SOLID has a 3-year roadmap with stakeholder consultations and phased deployment. Proper methodology. As they should—they're building sustainable research infrastructure.

I can experiment with applications, try different content sources, build proof-of-concept tools, fail fast, and iterate. cookies.zeeker.sg proved this—built in weeks, demonstrates the API works. While they're doing empirical research right, I can explore what's possible at the application layer.

**2. The validation wasn't about me**

I realized I was approaching the event asking: "Did my work matter? Did I influence this?"

Wrong questions.

The right framing: We both independently concluded Singapore needs better legal data infrastructure. That validation isn't about my influence—it's about the vision itself being correct.

We arrived at the same insight from different angles. Solo builder and institution both saw the gap. Whether SMU knew about data.zeeker.sg or not (they probably didn't—zero users, never announced), that matters more than individual credit.

So I'm renewing the domain. I'm continuing.

## My Decision: Continuing With Eyes Open

**What this means in practice:**

**Not:** Competing with SOLID
**Instead:** Exploring application layer and experimentation

**Not:** Waiting for perfect validation before announcing
**Instead:** Sharing what works, documenting what doesn't, inviting contribution

**What I'm committing to:**

1. **Finally announce data.zeeker.sg publicly** - No more "waiting until it's complete enough." It works. Time to share it.

2. **Document openly** - This series is part of that. Share what works, what doesn't, how it's built.

3. **Explore the application layer** - More tools like cookies.zeeker.sg that demonstrate what's possible with structured legal data.

4. **Stay complementary to SOLID** - Different scope, different strengths, both needed.

**What I'm accepting:**

- This might never have users. That's okay for labour of love.
- Institutions will do empirical research better. That's their strength.
- I might hand this off someday. But not today—I'm not done exploring.

## For Other Solo Builders

If you're facing similar crossroads—institutions entering your passion project space—here's what helped:

**1. Do the research first.** I went to their event uncertain. Understanding their actual scope—not my assumptions about it—enabled the decision. Don't decide in a vacuum.

**2. Give yourself time.** The decision took 12 days from invoice to renewal. The urgency felt artificial. Time between the trigger and the commitment matters.

**3. Use the framework diagnostically.** The three questions from Part 1 helped structure my thinking, but "I'm not done exploring" is ultimately an emotional answer, not logical. For passion projects, that's valid.

## What's Next

**This series:**
- ✅ Part 1: Framework for deciding when institutions enter your space
- ✅ Part 2a: Technical architecture of data.zeeker.sg
- ✅ Part 3: This post—my decision and what I learned

Part 2b (Lessons from AI-Assisted Development) is postponed for separate publication.

**For data.zeeker.sg:**
- Announcing publicly (finally)
- Documenting the infrastructure
- Building more applications
- Seeing what emerges

**The honest acknowledgment:**

I don't know if anyone will use this. I don't know if it matters beyond my own learning. I don't know if I'll sustain it long-term or eventually hand it off.

What I know: Singapore needs better legal data infrastructure. SOLID will build empirical research foundation properly. data.zeeker.sg can explore content infrastructure and applications. Both matter.

And I'm not done exploring.
