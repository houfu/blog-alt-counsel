# Pitch: Post 2 - "Why Legal Data Infrastructure Needs Institutions (And Why That's Good)"

## Working Title
"What I Learned at SMU's Legal Database Launch (And What It Means for data.zeeker.sg)"

## Core Argument
I spent 350 hours building data.zeeker.sg as proof that Singapore needs public legal data infrastructure. After attending SMU's project launch, I now understand what institutional backing actually looks like - and what it means for my decision to continue or hand off.

## Target Audience
- Legal tech builders wondering if they should build public infrastructure
- Institutions/funders considering legal data projects
- Solo practitioners who've built tools that outgrew them
- Anyone interested in sustainable models for public goods

## Structure (1000-1500 words)

### 1. Recap: What I Built and Where I Am (150-200 words)
Quick reference to Posts 1 & 2:
- Built data.zeeker.sg: 346 articles, 350 hours
- Proved the concept works
- DNS renewal coming up, decision point
- Documented the technical lessons

**Then I attended SMU's launch event on Nov 18...**

**Purpose:** Bridge from previous posts, set up what you learned at the event.

### 2. What Institutions Can Do That I Can't (300-400 words)
**The SMU Centre for Digital Law project:**
- 3-year timeline (not "spare time indefinitely")
- Full-time Research Engineer + Research Assistant
- Institutional resources and continuity
- Designed for sustainability from day one
- Similar in Canada and leading jurisdictions, benchmarking

**What this enables:**
- **Consistent quality:** Dedicated staff, not weekend hours
- **Sustainable coverage:** Funded for 3 years minimum
- **Proper infrastructure:** Resources for scaling
- **Team continuity:** Doesn't depend on one person's energy
- **Research integration:** Built into academic/legal ecosystem

**Contrast with solo builder model:**
| Solo Builder (me) | Institution (SMU) |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 350 hours over 7 months | Full-time staff for 3 years |
| Weekend/evening work | Dedicated work hours |
| One person's expertise | Team of specialists |
| Unclear sustainability | Funded timeline |
| Stops when I stop | Continues beyond individuals |

**Purpose:** Show concretely why institutional backing matters.

### 3. The Right Division of Labor (250-300 words)
**What individuals/solo builders are good at:**
- Rapid prototyping
- Proving concepts
- Identifying gaps
- Building MVPs
- Experimentation and innovation
- Scratching personal itches

**What institutions are good at:**
- Sustained operation
- Long-term maintenance
- Quality control at scale
- Resource allocation
- Continuity planning
- Integration with broader ecosystems

**The healthy pattern:**
1. Individual identifies gap and builds proof-of-concept
2. Usage/demand validates the need
3. Institution recognizes value and takes over
4. Individual moves on to next prototype

**What doesn't work:**
- Individuals trying to sustain institutional-scale infrastructure
- Institutions trying to innovate like individuals
- Solo builders becoming accidental infrastructure providers

**Purpose:** Frame the handoff as the natural and healthy progression.

### 4. What This Means for data.zeeker.sg (200-300 words)
**Possible paths forward (depending on SMU's scope):**

**If SMU's project overlaps significantly:**
- Consider handing off or shutting down gracefully
- Make data available to their team
- Avoid duplication of effort

**If SMU's project is complementary:**
- Different use cases might justify continuing
- Potential collaboration opportunities
- Singapore might benefit from multiple approaches

**If SMU's project is narrower than expected:**
- Gaps still exist that data.zeeker.sg fills
- Might be worth continuing with different strategy
- Or adapt to fill the gaps SMU doesn't cover

**The decision:**
After attending the event, I'll have enough information to choose:
- Continue (if there's a clear complementary role)
- Collaborate (if SMU could benefit from what I've built)
- Hand off gracefully (if they're covering the same ground)
- Shut down responsibly (if it's truly redundant)

**What I know now:** Whatever I decide, I'm not discouraged. The fact that institutions are investing in this validates that the gap is real and the work matters.

**Purpose:** Acknowledge the decision is still open, frame SMU event as providing the information needed to choose.

### 5. Practical Lessons for Builders and Institutions (300-400 words)

**For solo builders considering public infrastructure:**
1. **Build the MVP, not the institution** - Prove the concept, don't try to sustain it forever
2. **Document extensively** - Make it easy for institutions to understand and potentially take over
3. **Have an exit strategy from day one** - Plan for the handoff or shutdown
4. **Count the hours** - Know what you're committing to
5. **Make it forkable** - Open licenses, portable data, clear documentation

**For institutions considering legal data infrastructure:**
1. **Look for proof-of-concept projects** - Solo builders are testing ideas and proving demand
2. **Hire dedicated staff** - This isn't "extra work" for existing employees
3. **Plan for sustainability** - 3-year timelines, not pilot projects
4. **Integrate with research/academic missions** - Legal data serves multiple purposes
5. **Credit the prototypes** - Recognize the individual builders who proved it matters

**What I'm doing with data.zeeker.sg:**
- Full data dumps available (CC-BY-4.0)
- Documentation package preserved
- Offering to share lessons learned with SMU team if helpful
- Shutting down responsibly with user notice

**Purpose:** Actionable guidance for both sides of the equation.

### 6. The Bigger Picture (150-200 words)
**Why this matters beyond data.zeeker.sg:**

Singapore has many legal data gaps that could follow this pattern:
- Court decision databases
- Parliamentary debate archives
- Regulatory notice aggregation
- Legal form libraries
- Citation networks

**The healthy cycle:**
1. Solo builder identifies gap and builds proof-of-concept
2. Usage demonstrates value
3. Institution recognizes need and invests properly
4. Solo builder chooses: handoff, collaborate, or pivot to next gap

**Final thought:** Whether data.zeeker.sg continues or not, the fact that SMU is investing in legal data infrastructure shows this work matters. That's validation enough - and it informs my decision going forward.

**Next post:** I'll share what I decide after the Nov 18 event, and what I learned from the SMU team.

**Purpose:** End on hopeful note while acknowledging decision is pending.

## Unique Angle
Most "handoff" stories are about acquisition or transfer. This is about **validation** - individual work proved something matters, now institutions can do it right. It reframes "shutting down" as "mission accomplished."

## Tone
- **Hopeful, not defeated:** This is the good outcome
- **Validating for both sides:** Solo builders AND institutions have roles
- **Forward-looking:** What this enables for future projects
- **Generous:** Offering to help, sharing lessons learned

## Connection to Post 1
- Post 1: "Here's why I can't sustain this as an individual"
- Post 2: "Here's what the sustainable model looks like"

Together they tell a complete story: the problem AND the solution.

## Key Takeaway
Public legal infrastructure needs institutions, but individuals can prove what's worth building. The handoff from prototype to sustained operation is a feature, not a bug.

## Success Metrics
Post succeeds if:
- Solo builders feel validated in prototyping without lifetime commitment
- Institutions see a model for sustainable legal data projects
- The SMU project gets visibility and support
- Readers see this as hopeful, not discouraged
- Sparks more individualâ†’institution collaborations

## What Makes This Resonate with alt-counsel Mission
- **Resource-conscious:** Right-sizing who does what work
- **Practical models:** Not theory, actual example of SMU project
- **Singapore/ASEAN context:** Regional infrastructure building
- **Systems thinking:** Not just personal story, but pattern for ecosystem
- **Honest about constraints:** Individuals can't do institutional work

## Open Questions for Discussion
1. Should I reach out to the SMU team before publishing to offer collaboration?
2. How much detail about the SMU project (job descriptions, timeline)?
3. Should I explicitly say "I'm handing off to SMU" or keep it more general about institutional models?
4. Include a call-to-action for institutions to look for other proof-of-concept projects?
5. Should I keep data.zeeker.sg running until SMU launches, or shut down independently?

## Potential Challenges
- **SMU project might not want comparison:** Mitigate by framing as complementary, not competitive
- **Seems like I'm taking credit for SMU's work:** Emphasize they're building something better
- **Readers might think I'm bitter:** Counter with genuinely hopeful tone

## Key Phrase to Capture the Essence
"I spent 350 hours proving Singapore needs public legal data infrastructure. Now institutions are building it properly. That's exactly how this should work."
