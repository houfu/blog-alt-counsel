# Discussion Notes: Is Google Antigravity an 'IDE for Lawyers'?

## AUDIT TRAIL: Key Decision Points

### Decision: Hands-On Experiment Approach (2025-11-29, Session 1)

**Claude's Analysis:**
- Researched Google Antigravity (released Nov 18, 2025)
- Identified as agentic development platform (fork of VS Code)
- Found it supports Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-OSS
- Recognized angle: comparison with terminal-based tools like Claude Code

**Claude's Recommendation:**
Focus on comparison angle: graphical agent IDE vs terminal tools for lawyers who code

**User Decision:**
Approved hands-on experiment: build NDA generator to test Antigravity, compare with Claude Code workflow, research what others call "IDE for lawyers"

**Rationale:**
Real practical test beats theoretical discussion. User uses Claude Code daily, so direct comparison makes sense.

**Outcome:**
🔄 In progress - experiment to be conducted

### Decision: Post Tags (2025-11-29, Session 1)

**Claude's Analysis:**
- Read canonical tag registry
- Identified post sits at intersection of AI, legal tech, and programming
- Found precedent: tag registry shows AI + LegalTech + Programming is valid for implementation-focused legal tech

**Claude's Recommendation:**
Use 3 Core Topic tags: AI, LegalTech, Programming

**User Decision:**
Approved all three suggested tags

**Rationale:**
Captures the three-way intersection: AI-powered tools, legal automation, and coding workflow

**Outcome:**
✅ Tags documented in pitch.md

## WHAT CLAUDE DID (Contributions)

### Research
- Web search for Google Antigravity (released Nov 18, 2025)
- Identified Antigravity as agentic development platform (fork of VS Code)
- Found key features: autonomous agents, multi-model support, task-oriented development

### Writing
- Developed initial pitch draft (1st version)
- Refined pitch to include comparison angle and research component (2nd version - approved)
- Created pitch.md with metadata and suggested tags

### Quality Control
- Used tag-registry skill to suggest canonical tags
- Validated tags against naming conventions
- Ensured at least 1 Core Topic tag (ended up with 3, which is valid)

### Technical
- Created git branch: `claude/antigravity-ide-for-lawyers-014ujxoE5gFJecq7RyY9uf3U`
- Created post folder structure: `/posts/antigravity-ide-for-lawyers/`
- Saved pitch.md with metadata

## WHAT WORKED / DIDN'T WORK

### Worked Well ✅
| What Claude Did | User Decision | Outcome |
|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| Web search for Antigravity | Confirmed it's new (Nov 18, 2025) | Got accurate context |
| Suggested comparison angle | Approved hands-on experiment | Clear direction established |
| Used tag-registry skill | Approved AI + LegalTech + Programming | Consistent tagging |

### Didn't Work ❌
| What Claude Did | Problem | Lesson |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

## SESSIONS (Chronological Detail)

## Session 1: Pitch Development (2025-11-29)

### Context
User wanted to write about Google Antigravity and whether it makes a good "IDE" for lawyers. Initial idea was to build a simple NDA generator to test it.

### What Claude Did
- Research: Web searched for Google Antigravity (confirmed release date: Nov 18, 2025)
- Analysis: Identified as agentic development platform, fork of VS Code, supports multiple AI models
- Writing: Developed pitch focusing on comparison angle (Antigravity vs Claude Code) and research component (what is an "IDE for lawyers"?)
- Tools:
  - Created git branch for post
  - Scaffolded post folder structure
  - Used tag-registry skill for canonical tags

### User Decisions
- Decision 1: Approved hands-on experiment approach (build NDA generator in Antigravity)
- Decision 2: Approved comparison angle (graphical IDE vs terminal tools)
- Decision 3: Approved research component (what do others call "IDE for lawyers")
- Decision 4: Approved 3 tags: AI, LegalTech, Programming
- Decision 5: Created dedicated git branch before scaffolding

### Outcomes
- ✅ Pitch approved and saved to pitch.md
- ✅ Tags validated against canonical registry
- ✅ Post folder structure created
- ✅ Git branch created
- 🔄 Waiting for user to conduct hands-on experiment
- Files created: `/posts/antigravity-ide-for-lawyers/pitch.md`

### Next Steps
1. User will conduct hands-on experiment (build NDA generator in Antigravity)
2. Research what others claim is an "IDE for lawyers" (blog-research skill)
3. Draft content comparing Antigravity vs Claude Code based on experiment
4. Quality reviews before publishing
