# Is Google Antigravity an 'IDE for Lawyers'? Testing AI Development Tools

## Pitch

Google just released Antigravity, an AI-powered development platform that looks like VS Code but promises autonomous agents to handle coding tasks. As someone who uses Claude Code daily, I'm curious: does a graphical agent IDE beat terminal-based tools for lawyers who codes? But first, what even is an "IDE for lawyers"? Legal tech vendors throw around terms like this, but do they mean the same thing I do when I'm building an NDA generator? I'm running a hands-on experiment: building a simple NDA generator in Antigravity, comparing it to my terminal workflow, and researching what others claim is an "IDE for lawyers." No marketing promises—just practical comparison from a solo counsel who codes. Does Antigravity deliver on the agentic development dream, or is Claude Code's terminal approach still the better fit for legal automation work?
