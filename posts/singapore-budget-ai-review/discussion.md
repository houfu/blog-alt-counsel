# Discussion Notes: Singapore Budget AI Review

## AUDIT TRAIL: Key Decision Points

### Decision: Post Approach — Approach A (Modified) (2026-02-12, Session 1)

**Claude's Analysis:**
- Researched Singapore Budget 2025 AI measures for legal profession
- Researched government initiatives (MinLaw GenAI Guide, PSG-Legal, LIFT, TeSA, Harvey/judiciary collaboration)
- Researched global AI adoption problems (Harvey pushback, low adoption rates, declining digital adoption)
- Presented 3 approaches:
  - A: "If you gave every lawyer Harvey, would it save us?" — thought experiment as hook
  - B: "Singapore's AI budget for lawyers: What's real and what's marketing" — explainer/breakdown
  - C: "The 400% tax deduction won't teach you to rethink your workflow" — narrow and punchy

**Claude's Recommendation:**
Presented all three as viable; Approach A had the most narrative energy.

**User Decision:**
Approach A, modified. The thought experiment is the **hook**, but the **landing** is what matters — what would a transformation-first budget look like? The piece should walk through what government/MinLaw/Law Society/SCCA have done (give credit), then reason toward the transformation-first alternative.

**Rationale:**
User wants to give credit where due (not a takedown piece) but land on a constructive, forward-looking argument. The thought experiment pulls readers in; the transformation-first budget gives them something to think about.

**Outcome:**
Pending — moving to pitch phase.

### Decision: Target Audience Mix (2026-02-12, Session 1)

**Claude's Analysis:**
- Asked user which of 3 audience types to target
- Audience 1: Legal tech blog readers (technical)
- Audience 2: Sarah Chen (solo counsel, resource-constrained)
- Audience 3: Lawyer-coders (identity/projects)

**User Decision:**
"Probably 2, with more space for 1 than other types of audience"

**Rationale:**
Budget/policy content resonates most with resource-constrained practitioners (audience 2). Technical readers (audience 1) will appreciate the analysis depth. Less relevant for lawyer-coders (audience 3).

**Outcome:**
Pending — will inform pitch and writing.

## SESSIONS (Chronological Detail)

## Session 1: Brainstorming (2026-02-12)

### Context
User wants to write about Singapore Budget 2025's AI measures for the legal profession. Triggered by budget announcements about AI support for lawyers. User's instinct: skepticism that tool procurement = transformation.

### What Claude Did
- Research: Extensive search across 6+ queries covering Budget 2025 AI measures, MinLaw initiatives, Harvey AI adoption/pushback, legal tech adoption statistics, TeSA programmes
- Analysis: Synthesized findings into "what government has done" (credit) vs "the problems" (reality check)
- Presented 3 approaches (A: thought experiment, B: explainer, C: narrow/punchy)

### User Decisions
- Decision 1: Approach A (modified) — thought experiment as hook, transformation-first budget as landing
- Decision 2: Target audience primarily type 2 (solo counsel), with space for type 1 (legal tech readers)
- Decision 3: Structure should credit government/MinLaw/Law Society/SCCA before reasoning toward alternatives

### Research Findings Compiled

**What the government HAS done (give credit):**
1. MinLaw's Guide for Using Generative AI in the Legal Sector (Sept 2025 public consultation)
2. PSG-Legal - 70% funding for Legal Technology Platform + Copilot
3. LIFT pilot initiative (June 2025) for law firm digitalization
4. Court Guide on GenAI (2024) - Supreme Court
5. Tech-celerate for Law - $3.68M for digital solutions
6. Harvey AI collaboration with judiciary for Small Claims Tribunals
7. SAL + Microsoft prompt engineering guide
8. TeSA extension to legal profession, 400% tax deduction for AI (Enterprise Innovation Scheme), Champions of AI programme
9. SCCA (Singapore Corporate Counsel Association) involvement

**The problems/pushback:**
1. Only 28% of law firms actively using AI (Thomson Reuters survey)
2. Harvey pushback globally - hallucinations, pricing concerns (price slashed 60%)
3. Junior lawyer training erosion concerns
4. Desktop-first friction in legal AI tools
5. Confidentiality/data privacy concerns
6. Court already had to deal with fictitious AI-generated citations
7. Digital adoption among small businesses actually DECLINED in 2025
8. Only 18% have integrated AI across organization - most use off-the-shelf for isolated tasks

### Outcomes
- Files created: `/posts/singapore-budget-ai-review/discussion.md`
- Clear direction established for pitch phase

### Next Steps
- Generate pitch using generate_a_pitch skill
- Research may need deepening on specific budget numbers and transformation-first alternatives
