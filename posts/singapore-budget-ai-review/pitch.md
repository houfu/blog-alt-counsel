# Pitch: If Every Lawyer in Singapore Got Harvey Tomorrow

## Title
If Every Lawyer in Singapore Got Harvey Tomorrow

## Hook
Singapore's Budget 2026 goes big on AI — a PM-chaired National AI Council, 400% tax deductions for AI spending, free premium tools after training, a Champions of AI programme. But here's what caught my attention: within minutes of announcing these AI ambitions, PM Wong laid out the fear. AI is already reshaping white-collar and cognitive work. And the two professions he named first? Accountancy and legal.

The government is worried about our jobs.

## Core argument
"To support workers through this transition, we will help them build practical AI capabilities. Because AI is already reshaping many forms of white-collar and cognitive work, we will start with the accountancy and legal professions, and progressively extend them to other fields."

That's a direct quote from the Budget speech. Legal is on the list — not as a sector getting its own National AI Mission (those go to manufacturing, finance, healthcare, and connectivity), but as a profession the government thinks needs help surviving the transition.

Here's the thought experiment that keeps nagging me: if you gave every lawyer in Singapore access to Harvey right now, what would actually happen? The Law Society president flagged at the Opening of Legal Year 2026 that many lawyers can't effectively access or use technology — and that this affects access to justice.

The government deserves credit for what's been built — LIFT, PSG-Legal, the Legal Technology Platform with Copilot, LegalTechGoWhere. But the gap between "here's a tool" and "here's what's gonna happen to your job" remains wide. This post walks through the thought experiment, maps the real landscape, and asks what a transformation-first approach would actually look like.

## Structure
1. **Open**: The Budget 2026 moment — PM names legal as a profession needing AI transition support. The fear is now official.
2. **The thought experiment**: If every lawyer got Harvey tomorrow — what would actually happen? (Use adoption stats, Law Society president's concerns, real friction points)
3. **Credit where due**: Walk through what government/MinLaw/Law Society/SCCA have built (LIFT, PSG-Legal, LTP + Copilot, LegalTechGoWhere, MinLaw GenAI Guide, Court Guide on GenAI)
4. **The gap**: Tool procurement ≠ transformation. 28% adoption. Desktop-first friction. Junior lawyer training erosion. Digital adoption among small businesses actually declined.
5. **The landing**: What would a transformation-first approach look like? Not just "here's a tool" but "here's how your practice changes."
6. **Solo counsel reality check**: What this means for resource-constrained practitioners specifically.

## Target audience
- Primary: Solo counsels and small legal teams (Sarah Chen persona)
- Secondary: Legal tech readers who follow Singapore policy

## Tone
Give credit. Don't be a takedown piece. But be honest about the gap between tool access and practice transformation. The PM himself acknowledged the fear — lean into that honesty.

## Key quote to anchor
