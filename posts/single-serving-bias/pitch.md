# Pitch: The Single-Serving Software Bias

**Working Title**: "The Single-Serving Software Bias: Why Lawyers (and Coders) Undervalue One-Off Work"

In 2024, I wrote a 3-page prompt to generate one M&A term sheet and felt wasteful—why build something that only works once? Both coders and lawyers think in abstractions: reusable systems, precedents, templates. One-off work feels justified only for big matters or important clients. But Sam Harden's "Legal UI Revolution" revealed what I missed: when AI drops creation cost to 30 minutes, bespoke is viable for ANY client. More importantly, we're underutilizing what AI can now do—we use it for text generation (prompts, memos, documents) but not for interactive decision tools, custom visualizations, or matter-specific demos. AI has advanced far beyond prompt engineering, but our abstraction bias keeps us from applying its full capabilities. In 2026, I'm resolving to build single-serving legal software for regular clients and matters: custom interactive tools that only work once but deliver better client impact than another templated memo.

## Key Elements

**Personal Hook**: The 3-page prompt competition story (felt wasteful because it only worked once)

**Core Insight**: Both coders and lawyers have abstraction bias - we overvalue reusability and undervalue bespoke work

**Status Bias**: One-off work only feels "worth it" for big clients/matters

**Capability Gap**: AI can now build interactive tools, visualizations, custom demos - but we're still mostly using it for text

**The Shift**: When creation cost = 30 minutes, bespoke becomes viable for any client/matter

**2026 Resolution**: Build single-serving legal software - custom interactive tools that deliver better client impact than templated text
