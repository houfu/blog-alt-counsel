# Research: Single-Use Tools via Vibecoding & Abstraction Bias in Lawyers

**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Query:** Single-use tools created using vibecoding in Singapore (law-related preferred but not necessary) + Abstraction bias mindset in lawyers
**Regional Focus:** Singapore/ASEAN

---

## Summary

Vibecoding (rapid AI-assisted development) has enabled creation of single-serving software in both legal and non-legal contexts. Rebecca Fordon's work demonstrates legal applications (Boolean search game in 30 minutes, client intake forms with geographic checks), while Singapore's October 2025 hackathon showcased broader applications (AI productivity tools, dating platforms). Research on legal thinking reveals lawyers operate within an abstract/concrete paradox - using precedents and templates for efficiency while needing customization for each unique case. This tension between reusability (abstraction) and bespoke work (specificity) is fundamental to legal practice, but modern AI tools may challenge the traditional balance.

### Theme 2: Abstraction Bias in Legal Thinking

**Abstract/Concrete Paradox:**

- Lawyers activate inconsistent intuitions depending on whether problem is framed abstractly vs. concrete case
- Professional judges show this pattern: decisions differ in abstract vs concrete contexts
- Identifying information about plaintiffs drives the discrepancy
- Legal judgments in concrete cases linked to affective empathy toward plaintiffs
- Source: [Legal decision-making and the abstract/concrete paradox](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027720302407) - ScienceDirect | 🌍 Global research

**Levels of Abstraction in Legal Reasoning:**

- "Level of abstraction refers to the numbers of persons and transactions that generate an issue, to which evidence is true, to which arguments apply, and that are affected by resolution of an issue"
- More persons/transactions = higher abstraction level
- Source: [Levels of Abstraction in Legal Thinking](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/219376673.pdf) - Cornell eCommons | 🌍 Global academic research

**Precedents and Case-Based Reasoning:**

- "The basic pattern of legal reasoning is reasoning by example. It is reasoning from case to case."
- Rule-based reasoning has shortcoming: "humans do not think effectively in terms of abstract principles"
- Better understanding when principles expressed as stories/cases rather than abstract rules
- "Generalizations that express what has been learned cannot be separated from the cases they abstract"
- Cases provide meanings for generalizations
- Practitioners employ cases to operate with and on legal concepts
- Source: Multiple legal reasoning sources | 🌍 Global legal practice

**Templates vs. Bespoke Work Tension:**

- **Efficiency argument**: Templates save time, no need to "reinvent the wheel"
- **Customization requirement**: "Lawyers must review precedents carefully to ensure accuracy and shape them to their facts and current situation"
- **Challenge**: "It can be difficult if systems aren't up to the challenge, and lawyers will quickly lose faith in an out-of-date precedent system"
- **Modern approach**: Technology enables both - templates for efficiency, but customizable for specific needs
- Source: [Legal Document Templates: A Must-Have for Busy Lawyers](https://www.runsensible.com/blog/legal-document-templates-busy-lawyers/) | 🌍 Global legal practice

**Commoditization Debate:**

- "It makes no sense to have law firm after law firm implementing and attempting to maintain templates for standard kinds of contracts"
- "The substance should be commodities with no secret sauce"
- "It would make sense for law firms to get out of the template business"

## Jurisdictional Flags

⚠️ **Rebecca Fordon's Examples** - US-based but globally applicable
While Fordon's examples (Boolean search game, client intake forms) originate from US legal practice, the underlying philosophy and technical approach apply universally. AI coding assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) work identically across jurisdictions. The privacy-first approach (single HTML file, no data leaving browser) addresses compliance concerns relevant to Singapore's PDPA as well as US regulations.

⚠️ **Singapore Legal Tech Hackathon** - Limited specific project details
While we found a major Singapore legal tech hackathon (SMU LIT Legal-Tech Hackathon, Sept 13-14, 2025), specific single-serving tools created at this event weren't documented in search results. The general hackathon (October 2025, 400+ participants) provided non-legal examples.

⚠️ **Legal Reasoning Research** - Global academic literature
Research on abstract/concrete paradox and precedent-based reasoning reflects general legal thinking patterns, not Singapore-specific. However, precedent-based reasoning is fundamental to common law systems including Singapore, so findings remain relevant.

⚠️ **Template Management Debate** - US law firm context
Ken Adams' argument about firms "getting out of the template business" reflects large US law firm economics. For Singapore solo counsels and small firms (alt-counsel audience), templates remain valuable efficiency tools given limited resources. The tension between efficiency and customization persists regardless of jurisdiction.

---

## Alt-Counsel Angle

**The Single-Serving Revolution for Resource-Constrained Teams:**

Traditional wisdom says solo counsels should maximize reusability - build one template, use it everywhere. But vibecoding flips this: when you can build a bespoke tool in 30 minutes, you don't need everything to generalize.

**Practical implications:**
- **Client intake forms**: Instead of one generic form, build custom intake tools for different practice areas with specific logic (like Fordon's toxic plume map example)
- **Educational tools**: Create interactive explanations for complex legal concepts for specific clients (like Boolean search game adapted for client education)
- **Matter-specific tools**: Build custom checklists, decision trees, or visualizations for individual transactions when stakes justify 30 minutes of setup

**The $50 vs $50K insight:**
- **Old mindset**: Spend months building general platform OR pay $50K for vendor solution
- **New mindset**: Spend 30 minutes building exactly what THIS client needs, RIGHT NOW
- **Cost**: Anthropic/OpenAI API credits (~$0.50-$5 per tool creation) vs months of development or enterprise licensing

**Singapore context:**
- Vibecoding ecosystem well-established (400+ participant hackathons, government-subsidized bootcamps)
- Legal tech hackathons (SMU LIT) creating environment for experimentation
- Solo counsels can learn from broader tech community, not just legal tech vendors

**The abstraction bias connection:**
Both coders (DRY principle) and lawyers (precedent mindset) overvalue reusability. But when creation cost drops to 30 minutes, the calculus changes:
- Don't hesitate to build single-use tools for "regular" clients (not just VIPs)
- Stop optimizing for generalization when specificity serves client better
- Embrace throwaway tools if they solve immediate problem

## Research Notes

**Search Strategy:**
1. Started with "vibecoding Singapore examples 2025" - found major hackathon and bootcamp ecosystem
2. Searched for Rebecca Fordon specifically after Sam Harden mentioned her work - found detailed legal applications
3. Added "abstraction bias lawyers" searches - found abstract/concrete paradox research
4. Searched templates vs bespoke work - found ongoing tension in legal practice

**Key Insight from Research:**
The Singapore vibecoding ecosystem exists and is thriving (hackathons, bootcamps, government support), but specific LEGAL single-serving tools from Singapore weren't documented in public sources. Rebecca Fordon's US-based examples remain the best-documented legal applications. However, the technical approach is identical across jurisdictions.

**Potential Interview Subjects:**
- SMU LIT Hackathon organizers or participants (Sept 2025 event) - might have created legal micro-tools
- SGInnovate "Vibe Coding in Production" presenters (May 2025)
- Singapore Law Society's Legal Technology Committee - perspective on single-serving vs platform approach

**Content Gap:**
While we found excellent examples of single-serving software philosophy (Fordon) and Singapore vibecoding ecosystem, we didn't find documented examples of Singapore lawyers building single-serving legal tools. This could be:
1. Not yet happening (opportunity for user to be early adopter)
2. Happening privately (not publicly documented)
3. Search limitation (tools created but not described as "single-serving" or "vibecoding")

**For the article:**
User's own planned experiments with single-serving legal software for Singapore practice could be the unique contribution - demonstrating the concept in local context.

### Theme 3: Concrete Step-by-Step Examples (Addresses Pitch Gap #1)

**Sam Harden - "The Legal UI Revolution" (Full Article Content):**

1. **Living Will & Health Care Proxy Interactive Tool**
   - **Time to build:** ~15 minutes
   - **Platform:** Google Gemini (vibecoding platform of choice)
   - **What it does:**
     - Educates clients on why they need these documents
     - Interactive form completion (not just static PDFs)
     - Client-facing web app
   - **Key insight:** "Both of these could easily have taken 6 months and 5 figures of development cost just 4-5 years ago. But now it takes just a half hour"
   - Source: [The Legal UI Revolution](https://samharden.substack.com/p/the-legal-ui-revolution) | ✅ Florida-based but globally applicable

2. **Ladybird Deed vs Living Trust Visualizer**
   - **Time to build:** ~30 minutes
   - **What it does:**
     - Visual pros/cons comparison
     - Decision tree taking different scenarios into account
     - Shareable webpage for clients
   - **Harden's note:** "No change orders, no asking a developer to circle back, none of that. There's no need to even make it replicable - it's a single-serving"
   - Source: [The Legal UI Revolution](https://samharden.substack.com/p/the-legal-ui-revolution)

**Rebecca Fordon - Latest Article (Nov 27, 2025) - "Thanksgiving Vibe-Coding and the Case for 'Single-Serving' Legal Software":**

**Real Example She Actually Built:**

**Thanksgiving Checklist with Auto-Reschedule Feature**
   - **Problem:** Six dishes, tight timeline, guests running late
   - **Initial build:** Static timeline from AI
   - **Feature request:** "Add a feature where I adjust what time I've finished something so the rest will update"
   - **Result:** React-based interactive checklist with "I Finished This Just Now" button → entire remaining schedule auto-shifts
   - **Outcome:** Dinner only 15 min late (vs usual "at least an hour late")
   - **Key quote:** "My Thanksgiving experiment proves that the barrier to entry for building 'Micro-Tools' has collapsed"
   - Source: [Thanksgiving Vibe-Coding](https://www.ailawlibrarians.com/2025/11/27/thanksgiving-vibe-coding-and-the-case-for-single-serving-legal-software) | ✅ Nov 2025

**Legal Hypothetical Examples from Fordon (Nov 2025):**

1. **"Witness Wrangler" (Litigation)**
   - **Problem:** 15 witnesses, flights/prep/hostile witnesses, schedules depend on previous witness finishing
   - **Solution:** Dynamic dashboard shared with paralegal team
   - **Key feature:** Click "Witness A ran long; pushed to tomorrow" → app auto-alerts Witness B, updates car service pickup
   - **Gap it fills:** "Human logistics of a trial" that standard case management doesn't handle

2. **"Non-Standard Closing" (Ranch Sale)**
   - **Problem:** Closing checklist includes physical events: "Transfer Water Rights," "Inspect Cattle," "Repair Barn Roof"
   - **Solution:** Logic-based checklist where "Cattle Inspection" locked until "Barn Roof Repair" marked Complete
   - **Key feature:** If roof crew delayed → inspection auto-reschedules, alerts all parties

3. **"Toxic Plume Intake" (Mass Torts)**
   - **Problem:** Only sign clients in specific jagged geographic zone (1995-1998)
   - **Solution:** Simple web form with map
   - **Logic:** Point-in-polygon check against toxic plume map → instantly returns "Qualified" or "Out of Zone"
   - **Benefit:** "Saving hours of manual review"

**Fordon's MVP Philosophy:**
1. **Build** specific, hard-coded app for Jones v. Smith
2. **Validate** that it actually saved time (e.g., paralegal saved 10 hours)
3. **Generalize** only AFTER it proves value → use for Doe v. Roe

### Theme 4: Failure Modes & Limits (Addresses Pitch Gap #2)

**Boris Cherny - Creator of Claude Code (Dec 15, 2025):**

**When Vibe Coding Works:**
- ✅ "Throwaway code and prototypes, code that's not in the critical path"
- ✅ "I do this all the time"

**When It Doesn't:**
- ❌ "You want maintainable code sometimes. You want to be very thoughtful about every line sometimes"
- ❌ Models are still "not great at coding"
- ❌ "There's still so much room to improve, and this is the worst it's ever going to be"

**Cherny's Actual Workflow for Critical Tasks:**
1. Ask AI model to generate a **plan**
2. Iterate on implementation in **small steps**
3. "I might ask it to improve the code or clean it up"
4. For parts with **strong technical opinions** → write code **by hand**

**Key Quote:**
> "It works well for 'throwaway code and prototypes, code that's not in the critical path.' I do this all the time, but it's definitely not the thing you want to do all the time."

Source: [Claude Code's creator explains the limits of vibe coding](https://www.businessinsider.com/claude-code-creator-vibe-coding-limits-boris-cherny-anthropic-2025-12) | ✅ Dec 2025

**Other Tech Leaders on Limits:**

- **Sundar Pichai (Google):** "I'm not working on large codebases where you really have to get it right, the security has to be there" (Nov 2025)
- **Andrew Ng (Google Brain founder):** It's "fantastic" how quickly developers can write software, sometimes "barely looking at the code" - but this is noted as a CONCERN (May 2025)
- **General caution:** AI-generated code could contain mistakes, be overly verbose, or lack proper structure

**"The Dark Side of Vibe-Coding" - Arbisoft (Aug 8, 2025):**

**Cost of Failure:**
- Fixing defects **after deployment** costs **up to 30x more** than addressing during development
- Source: Research by Capers Jones & CAST Software analysis

**Where AI-Generated Code Fails:**
- ✅ "Can appear correct, pass initial tests, and integrate quickly"
- ❌ But "fail under uncommon runtime conditions"
- ❌ "AI models generate code probabilistically, not deterministically"
- ❌ Production failures in: authentication flows, data serialization, API integration layers

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Incorrect edge case handling (insufficient contextual understanding)
- API misuse (outdated/incomplete training data)
- Silent security flaws (improper input validation, insecure cryptography defaults)

**Technical Debt Hidden in AI Code:**
- "Syntactically correct and stylistically consistent" → maintainers overlook logic flaws
- Increased onboarding time (unclear decision rationale)
- Reduced test coverage (teams assume generated code is correct)
- Elevated bug rates in areas with dense AI contributions

**Security & Compliance Risks:**
- OWASP Top 5 vulnerabilities: Injection flaws, XSS, insecure direct object references, insecure deserialization
- Compliance costs for GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS violations
- "AI-generated code increases risk when it reuses insecure patterns from public repositories"

### Theme 5: Practical Implementation - Security & Tools (Addresses Pitch Gap #3)

**Security/Compliance Concerns (Rebecca Fordon, Nov 2025):**

**Solution for "No Data Leaves Firm":**
- "Single HTML file that you can then save and run entirely locally on your machine—no data leaves the browser"
- Enterprise LLM versions: "Your inputs remain within the firm's secure boundary"

**Platform Agnostic:**
- "Whether you use Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude, the ability to turn a prompt into a working React or HTML artifact is now a standard feature"
- "The power lies not in the specific model, but in your willingness to **ask for code instead of text**"

**Sam Harden on Tools (Dec 2025):**
- Gemini = "my vibecoding platform of choice"
- Note on testing: "Granted for these little apps you're not doing unit tests, integration tests, or user acceptance testing. But keep in mind tools like Antigravity and others now run their own tests during development"
- **Confidentiality caveat:** "Confidentiality would be a concern if you did this with vanilla Gemini (non-enterprise). I did this for the sake of example. Read the privacy policies!"

**Arbisoft on Governance (Aug 2025):**

**AI Code Security Guardrails:**
- Redact sensitive data before providing context to AI tools
- Apply automated static analysis (SAST) and dynamic analysis (DAST) on all generated code
- Manual security review for: authentication, encryption, data persistence

**Governance Tactics:**
- Define clear policy for AI usage scope within team
- Track AI contribution ratios and correlate with defect density metrics
- Schedule recurring codebase audits to refactor high-risk areas
- Tag AI-generated sections in version control for traceability

### Theme 6: ROI & Measurement (Addresses Pitch Gap #4)

**Arbisoft on Measuring AI ROI (Aug 2025):**

**Engineering Metrics to Track:**
- Mean time to resolution (MTTR) for defects
- Deployment frequency without quality degradation
- Defect escape rate from staging to production

**Recommendation:**
- Combine DORA metrics with defect classification data specific to AI-generated components
- Allows leaders to make informed investment and policy decisions

**Incremental Adoption Path:**
1. Pilot AI usage in **low-risk modules**
2. Embed continuous security and quality checks
3. Train developers in secure prompt design and validation
4. Monitor technical debt metrics tied specifically to AI-generated code
