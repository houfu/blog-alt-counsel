# Research: Single-Use Tools via Vibecoding & Abstraction Bias in Lawyers

**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Query:** Single-use tools created using vibecoding in Singapore (law-related preferred but not necessary) + Abstraction bias mindset in lawyers
**Regional Focus:** Singapore/ASEAN

---

## Summary

Vibecoding (rapid AI-assisted development) has enabled creation of single-serving software in both legal and non-legal contexts. Rebecca Fordon's work demonstrates legal applications (Boolean search game in 30 minutes, client intake forms with geographic checks), while Singapore's October 2025 hackathon showcased broader applications (AI productivity tools, dating platforms). Research on legal thinking reveals lawyers operate within an abstract/concrete paradox - using precedents and templates for efficiency while needing customization for each unique case. This tension between reusability (abstraction) and bespoke work (specificity) is fundamental to legal practice, but modern AI tools may challenge the traditional balance.

### Theme 2: Abstraction Bias in Legal Thinking

**Abstract/Concrete Paradox:**

- Lawyers activate inconsistent intuitions depending on whether problem is framed abstractly vs. concrete case
- Professional judges show this pattern: decisions differ in abstract vs concrete contexts
- Identifying information about plaintiffs drives the discrepancy
- Legal judgments in concrete cases linked to affective empathy toward plaintiffs
- Source: [Legal decision-making and the abstract/concrete paradox](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027720302407) - ScienceDirect | 🌍 Global research

**Levels of Abstraction in Legal Reasoning:**

- "Level of abstraction refers to the numbers of persons and transactions that generate an issue, to which evidence is true, to which arguments apply, and that are affected by resolution of an issue"
- More persons/transactions = higher abstraction level
- Source: [Levels of Abstraction in Legal Thinking](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/219376673.pdf) - Cornell eCommons | 🌍 Global academic research

**Precedents and Case-Based Reasoning:**

- "The basic pattern of legal reasoning is reasoning by example. It is reasoning from case to case."
- Rule-based reasoning has shortcoming: "humans do not think effectively in terms of abstract principles"
- Better understanding when principles expressed as stories/cases rather than abstract rules
- "Generalizations that express what has been learned cannot be separated from the cases they abstract"
- Cases provide meanings for generalizations
- Practitioners employ cases to operate with and on legal concepts

**Templates vs. Bespoke Work Tension:**

- **Efficiency argument**: Templates save time, no need to "reinvent the wheel"
- **Customization requirement**: "Lawyers must review precedents carefully to ensure accuracy and shape them to their facts and current situation"
- **Challenge**: "It can be difficult if systems aren't up to the challenge, and lawyers will quickly lose faith in an out-of-date precedent system"
- **Modern approach**: Technology enables both - templates for efficiency, but customizable for specific needs

**Commoditization Debate:**

- "It makes no sense to have law firm after law firm implementing and attempting to maintain templates for standard kinds of contracts"
- "The substance should be commodities with no secret sauce"
- "It would make sense for law firms to get out of the template business"

## Jurisdictional Flags

⚠️ **Rebecca Fordon's Examples** - US-based but globally applicable
While Fordon's examples (Boolean search game, client intake forms) originate from US legal practice, the underlying philosophy and technical approach apply universally. AI coding assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) work identically across jurisdictions. The privacy-first approach (single HTML file, no data leaving browser) addresses compliance concerns relevant to Singapore's PDPA as well as US regulations.

⚠️ **Singapore Legal Tech Hackathon** - Limited specific project details
While we found a major Singapore legal tech hackathon (SMU LIT Legal-Tech Hackathon, Sept 13-14, 2025), specific single-serving tools created at this event weren't documented in search results. The general hackathon (October 2025, 400+ participants) provided non-legal examples.

⚠️ **Legal Reasoning Research** - Global academic literature
Research on abstract/concrete paradox and precedent-based reasoning reflects general legal thinking patterns, not Singapore-specific. However, precedent-based reasoning is fundamental to common law systems including Singapore, so findings remain relevant.

⚠️ **Template Management Debate** - US law firm context
Ken Adams' argument about firms "getting out of the template business" reflects large US law firm economics. For Singapore solo counsels and small firms (alt-counsel audience), templates remain valuable efficiency tools given limited resources. The tension between efficiency and customization persists regardless of jurisdiction.

## Alt-Counsel Angle

**The Single-Serving Revolution for Resource-Constrained Teams:**

Traditional wisdom says solo counsels should maximize reusability - build one template, use it everywhere. But vibecoding flips this: when you can build a bespoke tool in 30 minutes, you don't need everything to generalize.

**Practical implications:**
- **Client intake forms**: Instead of one generic form, build custom intake tools for different practice areas with specific logic (like Fordon's toxic plume map example)
- **Educational tools**: Create interactive explanations for complex legal concepts for specific clients (like Boolean search game adapted for client education)
- **Matter-specific tools**: Build custom checklists, decision trees, or visualizations for individual transactions when stakes justify 30 minutes of setup

**The $50 vs $50K insight:**
- **Old mindset**: Spend months building general platform OR pay $50K for vendor solution
- **New mindset**: Spend 30 minutes building exactly what THIS client needs, RIGHT NOW
- **Cost**: Anthropic/OpenAI API credits (~$0.50-$5 per tool creation) vs months of development or enterprise licensing

**Singapore context:**
- Vibecoding ecosystem well-established (400+ participant hackathons, government-subsidized bootcamps)
- Legal tech hackathons (SMU LIT) creating environment for experimentation
- Solo counsels can learn from broader tech community, not just legal tech vendors

**The abstraction bias connection:**
Both coders (DRY principle) and lawyers (precedent mindset) overvalue reusability. But when creation cost drops to 30 minutes, the calculus changes:
- Don't hesitate to build single-use tools for "regular" clients (not just VIPs)
- Stop optimizing for generalization when specificity serves client better
- Embrace throwaway tools if they solve immediate problem

## Research Notes

**Search Strategy:**
1. Started with "vibecoding Singapore examples 2025" - found major hackathon and bootcamp ecosystem
2. Searched for Rebecca Fordon specifically after Sam Harden mentioned her work - found detailed legal applications
3. Added "abstraction bias lawyers" searches - found abstract/concrete paradox research
4. Searched templates vs bespoke work - found ongoing tension in legal practice

**Key Insight from Research:**
The Singapore vibecoding ecosystem exists and is thriving (hackathons, bootcamps, government support), but specific LEGAL single-serving tools from Singapore weren't documented in public sources. Rebecca Fordon's US-based examples remain the best-documented legal applications. However, the technical approach is identical across jurisdictions.

**Potential Interview Subjects:**
- SMU LIT Hackathon organizers or participants (Sept 2025 event) - might have created legal micro-tools
- SGInnovate "Vibe Coding in Production" presenters (May 2025)
- Singapore Law Society's Legal Technology Committee - perspective on single-serving vs platform approach

**Content Gap:**
While we found excellent examples of single-serving software philosophy (Fordon) and Singapore vibecoding ecosystem, we didn't find documented examples of Singapore lawyers building single-serving legal tools. This could be:
1. Not yet happening (opportunity for user to be early adopter)
2. Happening privately (not publicly documented)
3. Search limitation (tools created but not described as "single-serving" or "vibecoding")

**For the article:**
User's own planned experiments with single-serving legal software for Singapore practice could be the unique contribution - demonstrating the concept in local context.
