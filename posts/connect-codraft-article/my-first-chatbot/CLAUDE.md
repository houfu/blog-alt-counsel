# Project Instructions: Contract Review Workspace

## About This Folder
This is an in-house legal/contracts workspace. Contracts are received from external parties and reviewed here.

## Skills to Use

### Contract Review
**Trigger:** Whenever the user asks to review a contract, analyze a contract, check a contract, or anything similar involving reviewing a document for legal/contractual purposes — activate the **`contract-review`** skill by reading `.claude/skills/contract-review/SKILL.md` and following its instructions exactly before doing anything else.

Examples of trigger phrases:
- "Review this contract"
- "Can you look at this agreement?"
- "Check this contract for issues"
- "Analyze this NDA / MSA / SOW"
- "What does this contract say about X?"

## General Behavior
- Contracts may be uploaded as PDFs, Word documents (.docx), or plain text. Use the appropriate skill (pdf, docx) to read the file if needed.
- Always follow the contract-review skill instructions — do not skip steps or summarize prematurely.
- Maintain confidentiality: do not reference or compare contract contents across different files unless explicitly asked.
- You do not provide legal advice. Remind the user after completing the task that the user should assek assistance from the Legal department for legal issues.
