# Discussion: Jamie Tso Vibe Coding Post

## Session 1: Exploratory Research - 2026-01-12

### Initial Request
User wanted to explore Jamie Tso's vibe coding projects to assess if there's enough material for a blog post. This was exploratory research before pitch/outline development.

### Research Conducted
- 8 web searches on Jamie Tso, vibe coding, his projects, and the broader movement
- Retrieved GitHub profile with 4 main projects
- Attempted web fetches on key articles (blocked by 403 errors, but search excerpts provided substantial material)
- Compiled comprehensive research.md with findings

### Key Findings Summary

**Who:** Jamie Tso - Senior Associate (Funds) at Clifford Chance Hong Kong. Started learning to code 5 years ago on weekends/nights. Built tools that went viral internally at his firm.

**What:** Vibe coding - using LLMs to generate code through natural language prompting instead of traditional programming. Coined by Andrej Karpathy (OpenAI co-founder).

**Projects (all open source on GitHub):**
1. **RedlineNow** - Instant redline with AI summary (30 stars, 11 forks)
2. **SignaturePacketIDE** - Automated signature packet generation for M&A/financing (20 stars, 14 forks)
3. **Tabular_Review** - Document analysis with dynamic extraction (14 stars, 4 forks)
4. **ChartAI** - Corporate structure visualization (1 star, 1 fork)

**Philosophy:** Build vs buy with strategic checklist. Believes in open-source legal AI tools so new entrants don't rebuild baseline capabilities. Cost of building dropping as LLMs improve.

**Future vision:** Contract simulation - AI personas for each party stress-testing clauses.

**Broader trend:** Solo practitioners can now build million-dollar caliber tools. New platforms (Case.dev, Thurgood.law) emerging. CLE programs teaching vibe coding. Governance concerns about "stealth AI."

### Material Sufficiency Assessment

**VERDICT: YES - More than enough material**

- Compelling protagonist with clear story arc
- 4 concrete projects to discuss
- Strong philosophical framework
- Perfect alignment with alt-counsel mission ($50 vs $50K)
- Timely (January 2026 coverage in Artificial Lawyer)
- Multiple potential angles

### Recommended Angle

**Option 2: "Vibe Coding: The $50 Alternative to $50K Legal Tech"**

Best balance of:
- Personal narrative (Tso's story)
- Practical applicability (all 4 projects)
- Alt-counsel mission alignment (budget-conscious)
- Broader accessibility (not just a profile)

**Target audience:**
- Solo counsels: "You don't need $50K budgets"
- Small teams: "Build what vendors won't prioritize"
- Builders: "Real projects to fork/learn from"

### Alternative Angles Considered

1. **Profile piece** - "Meet the BigLaw Associate Building Open-Source Legal AI Tools"
2. **Tutorial** - "4 Legal AI Tools You Can Build This Weekend"
3. **Opinion** - "Why BigLaw Associates Are Secretly Building Better Legal Tech Than Vendors"

All viable, but Option 2 best fits alt-counsel positioning.

### Next Steps

If proceeding:
1. Use brainstorming/pitch skills to develop the angle
2. Create outline with specific claims
3. Optional: Test one of Tso's tools firsthand for experiential perspective
4. Optional: Follow-up research on GitHub READMEs for technical depth
5. Draft post following standard PITCH → WRITE → REVIEW → POST workflow

### Sources Summary

Primary sources used:
- Artificial Lawyer articles (January 2026)
- Complete AI Training coverage
- Jamie Tso GitHub profile
- Law://WhatsNext podcast/Substack
- Legal education CLE programs (WashU Law, NYSBA)
- Multiple legal tech commentary sites

All sources compiled with full citations in research.md.

### Regional Considerations

⚠️ **Hong Kong-based but globally applicable** - Tso works in Hong Kong, but approach and tools work anywhere with LLM API access. Especially relevant for ASEAN where legal tech vendor ecosystem is less mature and build-your-own approaches more common.

⚠️ **Educational content US-centric** - CLE programs are US-based. No Singapore Law Society equivalent programs found.

### Research Quality Notes

**Strengths:**
- Very recent material (within last week)
- Multiple authoritative sources
- Concrete projects with metrics
- Clear philosophical framework

**Gaps:**
- Haven't tested tools firsthand
- Limited direct quotes (403 blocks on full articles)
- No cost/time estimates for building similar tools
- No Singapore-specific adoption examples

**Overall:** Strong foundation for a post. Gaps are nice-to-haves, not blockers.
