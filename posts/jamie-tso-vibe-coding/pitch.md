# Pitch: I Build Infrastructure. Jamie Vibe Codes Tools. Here's What I'm Missing.

## The Pitch (180 words)

I compared my GitHub to Jamie Tso's and felt unproductive. Me: 70 repos, 177K monthly downloads, top 10% of PyPI. Him: 4 tools in 2-3 months, all built with vibe coding (LLMs generating TypeScript). Then I realized: I'm not slower—I apply infrastructure thinking to problems that need tool thinking. Jamie builds disposable tools for his Clifford Chance team: RedlineNow ships when it helps 5 colleagues close deals faster. I build permanent infrastructure for Singapore's legal community: my redlines library carries the weight of "every line of code is a long-term liability." When I want to build a contract review helper, I ask infrastructure questions: "What if others need this? What about edge cases?" Jamie asks tool questions: "Does this solve my team's problem today? Can I ship by Friday?" Most solo counsels need tools, not infrastructure. But legal training (precedent, edge cases, professional responsibility) makes us default to infrastructure thinking—even for quick weekend projects. This post unpacks the tool vs infrastructure mindset, when vibe coding works, and the mental model shift I need to actually use it.
