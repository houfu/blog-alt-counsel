# Feedback Request: Year in Review Post Angle

## Context

**Project:** data.zeeker.sg - Singapore's first public, searchable legal data infrastructure built with Datasette + SQLite. Contains 444+ curated legal news articles with professional summaries from April-December 2025.

**Analysis Done:** Ran SQL queries against the zeeker database and had Claude Opus analyze the data, revealing interesting trends including a shift in AI coverage from adoption enthusiasm to accountability/risk management.

**Target Audience:** Solo counsels, small legal teams, resource-constrained in-house departments who follow alt-counsel.com

## Two Possible Angles

### Angle 1: Substantive Finding
**Title concept:** "From Hype to Accountability: How AI Coverage Changed in Singapore Legal News in 2025"

**Focus:** Report on the actual trend - Singapore legal community's evolving relationship with AI throughout 2025
- Early 2025: Adoption enthusiasm, training programs, SAL initiatives
- Mid-2025: First accountability case (lawyer fined $800 for AI hallucinations)
- Late 2025: Firm policies treating GenAI breaches as sackable offences
- What this means for solo counsels and small teams

**Value proposition:** Actionable insights about regulatory direction and risk management

### Angle 2: Methodological Story
**Title concept:** "What 444 Articles Reveal: How a Legal News Database Unlocks Insights You Can't Get from Browsing"

**Focus:** Demonstrate the power of structured legal data by showing HOW the AI trend was discovered
- Questions you can ask a database that you can't ask a website
- The actual SQL queries used to discover the pattern
- Why having legal news in structured format matters
- The AI finding becomes one example among several

**Value proposition:** Demonstrates value of data infrastructure + teaches analytical approach

## Key Question

Which angle would be more interesting/valuable to the target audience?
- The substantive finding itself (AI accountability shift)?
- The methodological story about how structured data enables discovery?
- Or should it be a hybrid that does both?
