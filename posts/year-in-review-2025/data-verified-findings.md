2. **Senior lawyers are personally accountable** - delegation doesn't absolve supervision
3. **Firm policies have teeth** - from guidance to dismissal in 3 months
4. **Repeat incidents show enforcement is real** - courts are watching, firms are acting

**What changed:** Not the technology, but the consequences. October 3 made the abstract concrete.
