# Pitch: What 444 Articles Reveal

**Working Title:** "What 444 Articles Reveal: How AI Coverage Shifted from Hype to Accountability in Singapore (2025)"

**Date:** December 28, 2025

## The Story

Between April 2025 and January 2026, Singapore legal news coverage of AI flipped dramatically. In Q2 2025, three-quarters of AI articles focused on adoption opportunities—training programs, efficiency tools, SAL initiatives. By Q4, that reversed: three-quarters emphasized accountability, risk management, and professional discipline. The inflection point? July's $800 fine for AI-generated citations without verification. But this pattern only became visible when I analyzed 444+ curated legal articles from data.zeeker.sg using SQL queries and Claude AI.

The first 40% of the post delivers the finding: a visual timeline showing the quarter-by-quarter shift, key events that triggered the change (the fine, firm policy announcements, discipline cases), and what this means for Singapore lawyers navigating AI adoption today. The last 60% reveals the method: how to extract insights like this yourself using structured legal data and AI assistance—the actual SQL queries used, how Claude helped analyze patterns, and what other questions you could ask the zeeker database. For solo counsels and small teams, this demonstrates both the regulatory trend to watch AND a replicable analytical approach.
