2025-05-30T00:01:00,Woman who claimed ‘voices’ told her to abuse maid has jail term more than doubled to 7 years,"This article covers the High Court’s decision to more than double Anita Damu’s jail term for abusing her domestic worker, rejecting her defense of auditory hallucinations. Initially sentenced to 2 years 7 months based on psychiatric reports, the court found her claim of hearing voices fabricated after thorough assessment and testimony. Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon deemed the original sentence manifestly inadequate given the severity and cruelty of the abuse, increasing it to 7 years and raising compensation to $21,588. The case underscores judicial scrutiny of mental health defenses and reinforces accountability for domestic worker abuse in Singapore."
2025-06-03T00:01:00,Fighting deepfakes with content ‘nutrition labels’: Opinion,"This article explores emerging legal and technological responses to the deepfake crisis, focusing on content ""nutrition labels"" that verify authenticity. Key legal developments include the EU’s AI Act (2024) and California’s Digital Content Provenance Standards Act (2026), both mandating disclosure of AI-generated or manipulated content.

2025-08-28T00:01:00,AI’s disruption of law firms could hold lessons for the broader business community: Opinion,"The piece warns that generative AI can displace routine junior lawyer tasks, forcing law firms to redesign workflows, retrain lawyers to critically vet AI outputs, and tighten risk controls (confidentiality, engagement terms, governance) to mitigate malpractice and supervision exposure; expect a ~20–30% reduction in entry roles but higher-value work and new roles (AI-knowledge managers). For Singapore, systemic change—education reform, AI-skilled professional services, and robust implementation guidance—is urgent if the jurisdiction aims to remain a competitive financial-legal hub amid rapid tech-driven disruption."
2025-09-09T00:01:00,Prosecutors must be versatile to tackle challenges from AI-enabled crimes: Edwin Tong,"At the IAP conference, Law Minister Edwin Tong urged prosecutors to evolve legally and technically as generative AI lowers barriers to cross‑border crime—highlighting Interpol’s trillions‑dollar estimate, the McCartney child‑exploitation saga, and a regional takedown that seized AI‑made CSAM—to argue for multidisciplinary skills, updated prosecutorial powers over criminal-linked property, and stronger mutual legal assistance. Practically, this signals greater reliance on transnational cooperation, new MLAT frameworks (Singapore’s first Central Asian treaty with Kazakhstan), and evidence‑tech literacy for drafting charges, preserving digital evidence, and shaping policy to close enforcement gaps."
2025-09-12T00:01:00,AI-powered search engine to help Singapore lawyers with legal research,"Singapore’s LawNet now hosts GPT-Legal Q&A, an SAL–IMDA AI search trained on Singapore judgments, SLRs, legislation and texts to answer natural-language legal queries (launch phased, starting with contract law), designed to limit hallucinations by only citing its source corpus and to complement—not replace—keyword search; practical effects include faster research, retention benefits, and a reminder that attorneys must still verify AI outputs. IMDA also demoed an agentic AI for corporate secretarial automation (timely after the Corporate Service Providers Act), and SAL struck distribution deals with LexisNexis, Thomson Reuters, vLex and Legora to boost global access and citation of Singapore cases."
2025-09-30T00:01:00,"S’pore still plugged into global conversations on AI, despite lack of consensus on oversight","Singapore is keeping pace in global AI governance despite international disagreement—joining the UN’s new multistakeholder forum and independent 40‑member assessment panel—while exporting its playbooks via the Singapore Digital Gateway (AI Verify, Project Moonshot, National AI Strategy 2.0). Legally significant domestic moves include the forthcoming Online Safety (Relief and Accountability) Bill creating an Online Safety Commission with takedown powers and authority to disclose alleged perpetrators’ information, building on Singapore’s deepfake election ban; these developments signal enforceable national standards, cross‑border compliance challenges, and practical regulatory models for small states amid fractured multilateral oversight."
2025-10-03T00:01:00,Lawyer ordered to pay client’s opponent $800 after discovery of fake case created by AI,"A Singapore assistant registrar fined a solicitor $800 after a junior’s AI-generated, non-existent case citation appeared in court papers, stressing the senior lawyer’s duty to supervise, verify authorities and not mislead the court; the conduct was deemed improper, unreasonable and negligent. The ruling cites the 2024 guide allowing generative AI but mandating independent verification, echoes warnings from Chief Justice Menon and Justice Aidan Xu, and signals practical consequences—personal costs orders, reputational harm and heightened supervisory and verification obligations when using AI in litigation."
2025-10-14T00:01:00,"AI in healthcare a game changer for Singapore, if we get the rules right first: Opinion","Singapore’s piece warns that generative AI’s multi‑tasking capacity outstrips legacy medical-device regulatory frameworks, urging updates to the MOH/HSA AI in Healthcare Guidelines (AIHGle) and cross‑agency, international alignment; key legal issues are liability for AI‑generated misdiagnoses, informed consent and transparency about training data, explainability and bias, data‑provenance/privacy compliance, cyberattack risks, and evidentiary standards for real‑world validation. Regulators should treat AIHGle as a living rulebook, mandate rigorous post‑market surveillance/health‑technology assessment, and clarify clinician vs. vendor responsibilities to limit malpractice exposure while enabling beneficial deployment."
2025-10-22T00:01:00,Breaches of AI policy could be a sackable offence at some Singapore law firms,"Following a High Court finding that counsel improperly cited a hallucinated case and was ordered to personally pay S$800, Singapore firms now treat GenAI breaches as serious disciplinary matters—ranging from restricted tool access to dismissal—emphasising that lead lawyers remain personally accountable for AI‑assisted work. The decision (Tajudin v Suriaya) is among the first local precedents penalising AI hallucinations, prompting firms to mandate verification, disclosure, training, two‑tier oversight and bespoke tool safeguards; its key legal lesson is that reliance on unverified AI outputs can incur professional and financial sanctions."
2025-10-29T00:01:00,Use of Gen AI in legal practice must be balanced with careful oversight: Forum,"The Singapore Academy of Law urges firms to balance Gen AI efficiencies with clear oversight: adopt explicit internal policies (including sanctions), safeguard client confidentiality by vetting vendors, and train lawyers in prompt engineering and verification—recalling the recent hallucinated-case incident that underscores verification as a professional duty. SAL’s updated prompt guide and domain-specific legaltech (LawNet, LexisNexis, Thomson Reuters, vLex, Legora) offer safer research alternatives with curated databases and filters. Practically, firms should combine tool-specific controls, mandatory checks, and accountability mechanisms to preserve precision, integrity and regulatory compliance."
2025-11-05T00:01:00,"Law passed for scammers, mules, to be caned after victims in Singapore lose almost S$4b since 2020","Parliament passed the Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill (4 Nov 2025), imposing mandatory caning (6–24 strokes) for scammers and discretionary caning (up to 12) for facilitators like money mules, responding to about S$3.88bn losses since 2020; it also recalibrates caning for some offences. Key legal changes raise penalties for obscene-material and AI-generated sexual images, expand child-abuse definitions to realistic CGI, create a doxing-with-falsehood offence, toughen fatal abuse sentences (life now possible per a 2022 appeal rationale), broaden youth offender dispositions, and tighten precious-metals controls—raising deterrence and cross-border enforcement questions."
2025-11-06T00:01:00,Two lawyers rapped over ‘entirely fictitious’ AI-generated citations submitted to court,"The High Court (Justice S Mohan) rebuked two lawyers for citing “entirely fictitious” cases—likely AI‑hallucinations—in closing submissions in a loan recovery matter, prompting inquiry into who used what tool and why. The ruling underscores counsel’s continuing duty to verify authorities and to disclose use of AI; sanctions are pending and follow an October decision ordering costs for similar conduct. Practically, firms should enforce AI policies, lawyers face professional discipline or personal costs, and courts will treat AI‑generated citations as a serious breach of citation and ethical obligations."
2025-11-07T00:01:00,"International commercial court networks can help spot cross-border legal trends, says Singapore chief justice","Singapore Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon urged that transnational commercial court networks—exemplified by the new Bahrain International Commercial Court (BICC) with appeals to an International Committee of the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC)—can uniquely identify cross‑border legal trends (contract interpretation, arbitration standards, crypto asset status, generative AI) and foster doctrinal convergence through reasoned judgments. The BICC/SICC model permits foreign counsel, foreign law and English proceedings, offers neutral adjudication for truly international disputes, and raises sovereignty questions mitigated by its limited, commerce‑focused remit."
2025-11-14T00:01:00,‘Deliberate subversion’ of P1 registration framework can lead to jail sentence: Judge,"This roundup signals a tightening Singapore legal landscape: courts and regulators are enforcing stricter corporate governance and fraud accountability (notable jail terms, directors’ penalties, and a set‑aside of a major arbitration award), expanding statutory remedies for online harms and data protection, and proposing harsher sanctions for scammers (including caning). Professional discipline is sharpening—lawyers face disbarment or costs for misconduct, including misuse of AI-generated authorities—while IP, employment, family and health‑info reforms show broad policy shifts toward tighter oversight, greater victim redress, and higher compliance risks for practitioners and clients."
2025-11-24T00:01:00,Shady shades: Voyeurs and scammers can weaponise smart glasses – Commentary,"Smart glasses’ resurgence raises acute legal risks: covert recording, non‑consensual voyeurism, doxxing via live facial‑recognition and scraped data, deepfake creation, and distracted‑driver liability, yet statutes (e.g., voyeurism provisions) don’t neatly cover public or business settings. Expect businesses to adopt bans or policies (casinos as precedent), regulators to require tamper‑resistant recording indicators, and privacy/data‑protection claims and negligence suits where harms occur; criminal misuse could implicate stalking, fraud and image‑based abuse laws. Lawyers should watch emerging rules on device design, notice requirements, and civil remedies for reputational and privacy harms."
2025-12-11T00:01:00,Singapore Courts: Cases of AI Fabrication a “Misuse of Technology”,"Singapore courts have made plain that lawyers remain personally liable for all court submissions and that AI‑generated “hallucinations” are a misuse of technology, reiterating the Guide on the Use of Generative AI Tools by Court Users: AI output must be independently verified, accurate and appropriate. Recent incidents—costs ordered against Lalwani for citing a fictitious authority and a pending decision involving counsel who filed non‑existent cases—underscore risks of negligence, potential personal cost orders, disciplinary referrals to the Law Society, and the need for strict verification and confidentiality safeguards when using AI."
2025-12-11T00:01:00,Lawyers: AI is a supplementary tool and not a replacement for a lawyer’s judgement,"Recent fabricated‑case incidents show generative AI’s hallucination risk—especially in small firms with limited oversight—and underline that professional responsibility and verification remain paramount: lawyers must treat AI as a productivity aid, not a substitute for legal judgment, verify authorities cited, and disclose or obtain client consent where required. Large firms are responding with internal AI policies, training, supervised workflows, on‑prem tools and retrieval‑augmented systems to mitigate risks; expect continued emphasis on supervision, audit trails and possible Law Society/judicial guidance to codify disclosure, confidentiality and competency obligations."
