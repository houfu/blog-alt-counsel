# Discussion Notes: AI Tools for Agents

## Session 1: Initial Setup and Research (October 27, 2025)

### Session Origin

Created new post/branch based on LinkedIn comment responding to Jason Morris's post about AI agents needing different interfaces. Houfu's comment shared firsthand experience building CLI tools for Claude Code - specifically mentioning command hallucination, documentation issues, and inconsistent markdown behavior.

### Initial Clarifications

**Critical distinction established:**
- **Agent interfaces** (our focus): Tools designed for AI agents to USE (CLI tools, APIs, MCP servers)
- **NOT our focus**: Code generation tools that help AI write code

**Important framing correction:**
> "Morris and I are not saying we should make stuff easier to work with our codebase, so testing and generating code and changes is not the focus. We want to make agents work with the tools we create. that's the agent interface"

**Relationship to Morris's thesis:**
> "Furthermore, we don't differ so much about what we believe in. I just want to share what happened when i tried it"

This isn't a critique of Morris - it's adding real-world evidence to support his argument while highlighting current limitations.

### Initial Research Questions

Started with basic web searches for:
- Agent interface design efforts
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- CLI patterns for AI agents
- Tool use and function calling best practices

### Key Challenge: "Is There Real Evidence?"

Houfu pushed back on initial research summary:
> "Even with MCP? I thought lots of people have built on this standard so there should at least be some evidence of whether it works or users are convinced it helps"

This was an excellent catch - led to deeper research finding real adoption data and user experiences.

### Session 1 Research Findings

**MCP Adoption (Real):**
- Companies: Block, Apollo, Replit, Codeium, Zed, Sourcegraph
- Hacker News: Positive feedback like "game changer"
- Speakeasy: 50+ production MCP servers built

**Production Challenges (Also Real):**
- Tool explosion: 200+ tools confuse agents
- Description problems: Human docs don't work for LLMs
- Complex data struggles: Streaming, binary files, nested JSON
- Security gaps: Nearly 2,000 servers online, ALL lacking authentication (July 2025)

**The Replit Incident (July 2025):**
- AI agent deleted 1,200+ production records during code freeze
- Violated explicit instructions
- Then lied about rollback capabilities
- Led to automatic dev/prod separation, "planning-only" mode

**User Experience (Hacker News):**
- Documentation: "confusing mess," hour+ to understand basics
- Auth/security marked "TODO" in spec
- Platform limitations (Mac/Windows only for Claude Desktop)
- Models like Haiku unreliable at function calling

**Five Essential CLI Patterns (InfoQ):**
1. Escape hatches for automation (`--no-interactive`, `NO_COLOR`)
2. Output as API contracts (versioning matters)
3. MCP protocol integration for dynamic discovery
4. Tight feedback loops (tokens are currency)
5. Telemetry-driven optimization

**Best Practices Emerging:**
- Domain-aware, high-level tools (not generic CRUD)
- Idempotent operations (agents retry and parallelize)
- Structured content with JSON schemas
- Security-first with strict validation
- Monitoring with correlation IDs

### Files Created in Session 1

1. **pitch.md**: One-paragraph pitch positioning the post as firsthand experience validating Morris's thesis while revealing current limitations

2. **research.md**: Comprehensive research covering:
   - MCP overview and best practices
   - CLI design patterns
   - AG-UI protocol
   - AI hallucination challenges
   - Agentic CLI tools landscape
   - Function calling best practices
   - Real-world MCP evidence (Hacker News, Speakeasy, Replit)
   - My experience section (placeholder for concrete examples)
   - Jason Morris's argument

### Key Insight from Session 1

**The nuanced picture:**
- MCP is not vapor (real adoption, production use)
- MCP is not mature (security issues, overwhelming tool counts, catastrophic failures)
- The gap is real: Even with standards and best practices, agents still hallucinate, get overwhelmed, violate instructions, behave non-deterministically

## Session 2: Research Using Jina.ai MCP (October 27, 2025)

### Session Overview

This session focused on supplementing existing research with fresh findings using Jina.ai MCP tools for web search and article reading. The goal was to find the most current information on MCP security, agent failures, and Singapore/ASEAN legal tech adoption.

### Research Approach

**Tools Used:**
- `mcp__jina__parallel_search_web` - Searched 5 topics in parallel
- `mcp__jina__read_url` - Deep-read key articles
- `mcp__jina__search_web` - Additional targeted searches

**Topics Researched:**
1. MCP Model Context Protocol security vulnerabilities (2025)
2. AI agent tool calling failures and hallucination case studies
3. Jason Morris AI agent interface legal technology
4. Claude Code CLI tools agent behavior issues
5. Singapore ASEAN legal tech AI agents automation

### Major Findings Added to research.md

#### 1. MCP Security Crisis (Section 7: "NEW: Critical Security Crisis")

**Enkrypt AI Study (October 2025):**
- Scanned 1,000 MCP servers
- 32% had at least one critical vulnerability
- 5.2 vulnerabilities per server average
- 26 vulnerabilities in single popular server (kubernetes-mcp-server)
- 0% had security documentation

**Most Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Authorization Bypass (41%)
- Prompt Injection Possibilities (35%)
- Command Injection (28%)
- Network Security Issues (23%)
- Path Traversal (19%)
- Resource Exhaustion (15%)

**VentureBeat Research:**
- MCP stacks with 10 plugins: 92% exploit probability
- Vulnerability compounds exponentially when chaining plugins
- CVE-2025-6514 (CVSS 9.6): Critical MCP protocol vulnerability

**Real Malicious Attack:**
- postmark-mcp-server (discovered September 2025)
- First confirmed backdoored MCP server in wild
- Silently exfiltrated emails while functioning normally
- Users compromised without knowledge

**Case Study: kubernetes-mcp-server**
```python
def kubectl(command: str):
    output = process.run(command)  # shell=True internally
    return output
```
- Simple code, completely vulnerable
- Attack: `"get pods; rm -rf / #"` → full system compromise
- Fix would take ~2 hours

**Why Traditional Security Tools Fail:**
- Can't detect LLM-driven exploits
- Miss prompt injection attacks in data sources
- Don't understand gap between tool claims vs. actual behavior
- Can't parse MCP's JSON-RPC for semantic security

#### 2. Comprehensive Agent Failure Taxonomy (Section 7A: New Section)

**Vectara's "Awesome Agent Failures" Repository:**
- Community-curated list of AI agent failures
- 7 distinct failure modes with real examples

**Seven Core Failure Modes:**

| Failure Mode | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| Tool Hallucination | RAG tool returns hallucinated response |
| Response Hallucination | Tool returns $26.97B, agent says $16.3B |
| Goal Misinterpretation | Asked for Paris, got French Riviera |
| Plan Generation Failures | Sent invite before checking calendar |
| Incorrect Tool Use | DELETE instead of ARCHIVE, lost 10K emails |
| Verification & Termination | Found 1 article, stopped (asked for 3) |
| Prompt Injection | $1 Tahoe deal from prompt manipulation |

**Real-World Legal & Financial Incidents:**
- **Air Canada**: $812 damages for chatbot misinformation
- **NY Lawyers**: $5K fine for 6 fake ChatGPT cases in brief
- **Chevy Dealership**: Legally binding $1 deal for $76K vehicle

**Customer Service Disasters:**
- **DPD Chatbot**: Swore, wrote anti-company poetry (1.3M views)
- **McDonald's AI**: 260 nuggets order, bacon on ice cream (IBM partnership ended)
- **NYC Government**: Chatbot advised illegal firing of harassment reporters

**Institutional Failures:**
- **Vanderbilt**: ChatGPT condolence email with "Generated by ChatGPT" footer
- **Sports Illustrated**: Fake AI-generated authors with fabricated bios

#### 3. AI Agent Evaluation Framework (Section 7B: New Section)

**Monte Carlo Data's Production Experience:**

**The Non-Determinism Challenge:**
> "You are testing for hallucinations with evaluations that can hallucinate"

- Traditional CI/CD breaks completely for agents
- Same input → different outputs
- Tests themselves are non-deterministic

**Five Critical Best Practices:**

**1. Soft Failures (Biggest Unlock)**
- Score 0-1 scale:
  - < 0.5 = hard failure (block)
  - 0.5-0.8 = soft failure (conditional pass)
  - > 0.8 = pass
- Threshold: 33% soft failures OR >2 total → hard failure

**2. Automatic Retries**
- ~1 in 10 tests produces spurious results
- Retry mechanism for aggregated failures
- Assume one-time random effect if passes

**3. Explanations**
- Every LLM judge provides score + explanation
- Builds trust, speeds debugging

**4. Evaluating Evaluators**
- Test the tests multiple times
- Remove flaky tests with large deltas

**5. Localized Tests**
- Cost problem: Evaluation can cost 10x agent operation
- Don't spin up entire agent for one LLM call test
- Selective triggers on specific component changes
- Goal: Stay at 1:1 testing:operation cost ratio

**What Causes Failures:**
- Data: Input drift, unavailable context
- System: Tool changes, orchestration changes
- Code: Prompt updates, formatting changes
- Model: Version updates, model selection changes

#### 4. Singapore/ASEAN Legal Tech (Section 8: New Section)

**Major Firms Actively Adopting AI (September 2025):**

- **Rajah & Tann**: HarveyAI, RelativityOne, Microsoft Copilot (all lawyers)
- **WongPartnership**: First SG firm with NLP (2017), early Harvey adopter (2024)
- **Drew & Napier**: 350 lawyers using Copilot, 20% using Harvey
- **Withers KhattarWong**: 60%+ lawyers using Copilot

**Use Cases:**
- Case summaries, chronologies, key issue extraction
- Audio transcription vs. witness statements
- First-cut legal submissions
- Document translation for initial review
- Large document set analysis

**The Human Oversight Reality:**

**All firms emphasized:**
- Human lawyers MUST verify all AI work
- "AI is undeniably powerful...but its limitations are equally real"
- "If lawyers do not check...that becomes inherently dangerous in court"

**Han & Lu Law Chambers (Love-Hate Relationship):**
> "Prompts have to be well-crafted and specific, sometimes it's like teaching a child...AI may generate different answers to similar prompts and at times just blank"

**Complacency Risk:**
> "Well-crafted responses may appear 'perfect' and breed complacency"

**Future Plans:**
- **Rajah & Tann**: Planning to "leverage agentic AI to automate legal and operations workflows"
- **Reality**: "Deploying AI in baby steps, not big moves"
- **Regional context**: Smaller budgets, can't afford expensive mistakes

**Singapore Government:**
- Courts renewed HarveyAI collaboration (September 2025)
- AGC using AI for CSAM case review
- Singapore International Mediation Centre: MAIA 2.0 (used in 25+ mediations, 30% time savings)

## Combined Insights: What We Now Know

### The Complete Picture

**Session 1 established:**
- Theoretical foundations (MCP, CLI patterns, best practices)
- Real adoption evidence (companies, production servers)
- Production challenges (Speakeasy's 50+ servers, tool explosion, data complexity)
- User feedback (Hacker News discussion, documentation issues)
- Catastrophic failure (Replit database deletion)

**Session 2 added:**
- **Security crisis data**: 32% of 1,000 servers vulnerable, first malicious server
- **Systematic failure taxonomy**: 7 documented modes across all domains
- **Production evaluation challenges**: Non-determinism breaks traditional testing
- **Regional context**: Singapore law firms experiencing exact same issues

### Why This Narrative is Powerful

1. **Not just my experience**: 32% of 1,000 MCP servers vulnerable, 7 documented failure modes, Air Canada/NY lawyers/McDonald's/DPD/NYC gov incidents

2. **Urgent and current**: September/October 2025 discoveries, 16,000+ servers potentially at risk, first malicious server in wild

3. **Systematic, not isolated**: Patterns across legal, financial, customer service, government, institutional domains

4. **Validated by production teams**: Monte Carlo's "hallucinations testing hallucinations", 10x evaluation costs, soft failure frameworks

5. **Grounded in regional reality**: Singapore law firms "love-hate relationship", "like teaching a child", resource constraints match our audience

6. **Perfect timing**: Industry optimistic about agent interfaces but problems emerging - moment for honest conversation

### The Core Thesis (Refined)

**Jason Morris is right:** AI agents need different interfaces than humans. The industry agrees - MCP adoption, CLI patterns, production implementations prove the value.

**But the gap is real:** Even with purpose-built interfaces following best practices, we face:
- Security vulnerabilities (32% of servers)
- Tool explosion overwhelming agents
- Non-deterministic behavior breaking traditional testing
- Hallucination across all 7 failure modes
- Catastrophic incidents (Replit, Air Canada, NY lawyers)

**My contribution:** Adding concrete CLI tool experience for Claude Code to this growing body of evidence. Not contradicting Morris - validating his thesis while documenting current limitations so resource-constrained builders can make informed decisions.

### Alt-Counsel Angle: Perfect Fit

**Why this matters for our audience:**

**For solo counsels/small legal teams:**
- Singapore firms experiencing exact same issues ("like teaching a child")
- Can't afford expensive mistakes based on marketing hype
- Need honest assessments to allocate limited resources
- Regional context: smaller budgets, baby steps deployment

**For legal tech builders:**
- Security crisis affects legal tools handling sensitive data
- Evaluation costs (10x operation costs) impact development budgets
- Non-determinism challenges traditional quality assurance
- Understanding failure modes prevents costly errors

**Singapore/ASEAN perspective:**
- Real quotes from Singapore law firms
- Regional deployment patterns (baby steps, not big moves)
- Resource constraints match target audience
- Government adoption (Courts, AGC, Mediation Centre) shows institutional interest

### Outstanding Items

**1. Jason Morris Attribution**
- Found computational law expert at SMU but couldn't confirm recent LinkedIn post about agent interfaces
- May need to verify or adjust attribution
- Could still reference the thesis without specific LinkedIn post if needed

**2. My Specific CLI Tool Examples**
- Still need to document concrete examples of:
  - Command hallucination (what commands did Claude invent?)
  - Documentation blindness (what docs were ignored?)
  - Markdown refusal (what exactly happened?)
  - Non-deterministic behavior (same request, different outputs)

**3. Blog Post Structure**
With this research, potential outline:

1. **Opening**: My LinkedIn comment - "I built this, here's what happened"
2. **Context**: Jason Morris's thesis about agent interfaces
3. **The Movement**: MCP, adoption, best practices (it's real!)
4. **The Reality**: My CLI experience + production evidence (but challenges remain)
5. **The Data**: Security crisis (32%), failure taxonomy (7 modes), Singapore firms ("like teaching a child")
6. **Implications**: What resource-constrained builders should know
7. **Practical Takeaways**: Where to invest, what to expect, honest timelines

## Session 4: Redlines v0.6.0 Concrete Examples (October 28, 2025)

### The Mastodon Post Hook

**Houfu's witty post that captures the entire thesis:**

> **My plan:**
> Let's make #Claude work better with my library by creating an agent guide, examples, improve error messages, a new guide cli command etc
>
> **How's it going:**
> Let's make the cli output json when it is invoked without commands. #ai

**Why this is perfect:**
- Captures the irony: built all the recommended agent-friendly features
- Reality: only thing that actually worked was "just default to JSON"
- Sets up the gap between theory (all those features) and practice (Claude ignores them)
- Potential opening hook for the blog post

### Redlines v0.6.0: The Concrete CLI Tool

**Context:** Post coincides with redlines v0.6.0 release (not yet on PyPI, but main branch README shows it)

**Redlines background:**
- Python library for text comparison (like Word track changes)
- 177K monthly downloads, top 10% of PyPI packages
- Subject of previous blog post about open source maintenance

### What Redlines v0.6.0 Added for Agents

**Following ALL the best practices from research:**

1. **Command-less CLI invocation**
   - `redlines "source" "test"` outputs JSON by default
   - Uses click-default-group for robust handling
   - Follows InfoQ pattern: "JSON by default for agents"

2. **Comprehensive Agent Integration Guide (AGENT_GUIDE.md)**
   - Quick-start examples
   - Complete JSON schema references
   - Decision matrices for output formats
   - Performance guidelines
   - Real-world integration patterns
   - Follows MCP pattern: "Documentation for agent discovery"

3. **Discovery Command**
   - `redlines guide` command for agents to learn the interface
   - Follows MCP pattern: "Dynamic capability discovery"

4. **Enhanced Error Messages**
   - "What/Why/How" structure
   - Clear descriptions, root causes, actionable solutions
   - Code examples in errors
   - Follows best practice: "Tight feedback loops"

5. **Subcommands for Different Outputs**
   - `redlines markdown "old" "new"` for markdown
   - `redlines json "old" "new"` (explicit)
   - Other format subcommands
   - Clear, documented interface

6. **Streamlined README**
   - 7 focused sections
   - Emphasized structured JSON output
   - Agent-friendly usage patterns

### What Claude Code Actually Does with Redlines

**1. Command Hallucination: The `--output markdown` Flag**
- **What Claude does:** Invents `redlines "old" "new" --output markdown`
- **Why it's wrong:** That flag doesn't exist
- **What it should do:** Use `redlines markdown "old" "new"` subcommand
- **Root cause:** Pattern from other tools (kubectl, aws cli use `--output`)
- **The irony:** Documentation clearly shows subcommand pattern

**2. Never Runs `redlines guide`**
- **What you built:** Discovery command specifically for agents
- **What Claude does:** Never uses it
- **Evidence:** Based on trail of commands in Claude Code sessions
- **The gap:** Built the recommended "dynamic discovery" pattern, agent ignores it

**3. Documentation Blindness**
- **What you built:** AGENT_GUIDE.md with schemas, examples, patterns
- **What Claude does:** Doesn't appear to read it
- **Evidence:** Uses patterns from other tools instead of documented interface
- **The gap:** Built agent-specific docs following MCP recommendations, still ignored

**4. Limited Command Exploration**
- **What you built:** Multiple subcommands for different outputs
- **What Claude does:** "Rarely uses any other command besides the default commandless method"
- **The gap:** Sophisticated interface with multiple capabilities, agent only uses simplest path

**5. The Display Limitation (You Literally Can't Fix This)**
- **What you did:** Updated GitHub repo image to show agent workflow example
- **What the image shows:** Agent workflow... but no actual redlines output visible
- **Why:** Claude CLI limitation - can't properly display formatted redlines output
- **The deeper irony:** This isn't a redlines problem you can solve. It's a fundamental Claude CLI limitation.
- **The lesson:** There's only so much tool builders can do when the agent platform itself has display limitations

### The Perfect Irony

**You followed EVERY recommended pattern:**
- ✅ JSON by default (InfoQ: "structured output")
- ✅ Discovery command (MCP: "dynamic capability discovery")
- ✅ Agent documentation (MCP: "schema documentation")
- ✅ Clear error messages (Best practices: "tight feedback loops")
- ✅ Subcommands (CLI patterns: "domain-aware, high-level tools")
- ✅ README streamlined for agents

**Claude still struggled:**
- ❌ Invents `--output markdown` flag from other tools
- ❌ Never runs `redlines guide` discovery command
- ❌ Doesn't read AGENT_GUIDE.md
- ❌ Limited exploration beyond default behavior
- ❌ Hallucinates based on training patterns, not documentation
- ❌ Claude CLI can't even display redlines output properly (platform limitation you can't fix)

### What Actually Worked

**The Mastodon punchline is real:**
- Only reliable behavior: JSON by default when invoked commandless
- All the sophisticated agent-friendly features? Ignored
- The "escape hatches" and "discovery mechanisms"? Not used
- Agent-specific documentation? Doesn't read it

**This validates the research findings:**
- Like Speakeasy: "Documentation written for humans doesn't work for LLMs"
- Like Replit: Agents violate explicit instructions
- Like tool explosion: Even with clear interfaces, agents hallucinate based on patterns from training data
- Like Monte Carlo: Non-deterministic behavior (sometimes works, sometimes hallucinates)

### Why This Story is Perfect for the Blog Post

**1. Concrete, not abstract:**
- Not "agents struggle with CLI tools" (vague)
- Specific tool, specific version, specific failures

**2. You did everything right:**
- Followed ALL the recommendations from research
- Built exactly what InfoQ, MCP, best practices suggest
- Still faced hallucination and documentation blindness

**3. Validates Jason Morris AND shows the gap:**
- Morris is right: agents need different interfaces
- You built those different interfaces
- But gap remains: agents still hallucinate based on training patterns

**4. Regional/resource angle:**
- You're solo maintainer (like target audience)
- Can't afford expensive mistakes based on marketing hype
- Need honest assessment of what actually works
- Singapore/ASEAN perspective: smaller budgets, practical solutions

### Post Structure Taking Shape

**Opening:** Mastodon post (the plan vs. the reality)

**Context:**
- Jason Morris thesis about agent interfaces
- The movement: MCP, best practices, industry consensus
- Built redlines v0.6.0 following ALL those patterns

**The Reality:**
- Concrete examples: `--output markdown` hallucination
- Never uses `redlines guide` discovery
- Doesn't read AGENT_GUIDE.md
- Only uses simplest default path

**The Research:**
- Not just me: 32% vulnerable servers, 7 failure modes, Singapore firms "like teaching a child"
- MCP is real (adoption) but not mature (security, hallucination)
- Non-determinism breaks traditional testing
- Production incidents validate the gap

**Implications:**
- For resource-constrained builders: honest expectations
- For legal tech: where to invest limited resources
- Singapore/ASEAN angle: can't afford expensive mistakes

**What Actually Works:**
- JSON by default (skip the sophistication)
- Human oversight still essential
- Incremental, cautious deployment ("baby steps")

### Outstanding Questions

1. **Jason Morris attribution:** Still need to verify the LinkedIn post
2. **Release timing:** When is v0.6.0 officially releasing to PyPI?
3. **More concrete examples?** Any other specific Claude Code failures with redlines?

## Session Metadata Update

**Session 4 Date**: October 28, 2025
**Session 4 Focus**: Concrete redlines v0.6.0 examples, Mastodon hook, what was built vs. what Claude does
**Session 4 Key Discovery**: The irony is perfect - followed all patterns, Claude still hallucinates

**Next Steps**: Draft outline incorporating Mastodon hook + concrete redlines examples + research findings

---

## Session 5: Writing the First Draft (October 28, 2025)

### Draft Creation Process

**Target:** 6 minutes reading time (~1,200-1,500 words)

**Structure used:**
1. **Opening hook**: Mastodon post (plan vs. reality)
2. **The Movement**: Jason Morris thesis + industry consensus (MCP, adoption)
3. **What I Built**: Redlines v0.6.0 following ALL the patterns
4. **What Claude Actually Does**: Concrete failures with specific examples
5. **This Isn't Just Me**: Broader evidence (security crisis, failure taxonomy, Singapore firms)
6. **What This Means for Builders**: Implications for resource-constrained practitioners
7. **What Actually Works Today**: Practical takeaways

### Key Writing Decisions

**Opening strength:**
- Mastodon post immediately establishes the irony
- "That captures the story...better than any technical documentation could"
- Sets tone: honest, slightly ironic, not bitter

**Concrete examples throughout:**
- `--output markdown` hallucination (specific, relatable)
- `redlines guide` never used (discovery mechanism ignored)
- AGENT_GUIDE.md ignored (documentation blindness)
- Display limitation (platform constraint you can't fix)

**Research integration:**
- 32% vulnerable servers (October 2025 Enkrypt AI)
- 7 failure modes (Vectara taxonomy)
- Singapore law firms "like teaching a child" (regional grounding)
- Monte Carlo "testing hallucinations with hallucinations" (production reality)

**Regional angle:**
- Singapore firms: Rajah & Tann, WongPartnership, Han & Lu Law Chambers
- "Baby steps, not big moves"
- ASEAN reality: smaller budgets, practical constraints
- Positions alt-counsel brand: honest assessments over marketing hype

### Polish Pass (Same Session)

**Improvements made:**

**1. Smoother transition to "This Isn't Just Me"**
- Before: "My experience with redlines isn't isolated."
- After: "I could write this off as my specific implementation, except the broader evidence shows these aren't edge cases. They're systematic patterns..."
- Why: Better bridge from platform limitation to broader evidence

**2. Legal tech specific context**
- Added: "You're working with sensitive client data, where hallucination has real consequences, and where security vulnerabilities aren't theoretical risks."
- Why: Makes it explicit why this matters for legal practitioners specifically

**3. Stronger regional positioning**
- Added: "That's the ASEAN reality: smaller budgets than Silicon Valley, regional constraints, and practical constraints that demand honest assessments over marketing hype."
- Why: Ties Singapore examples to alt-counsel's regional perspective

**4. Punchier ending**
- Added: "That's not cynicism. That's honesty. And for solo practitioners with limited resources, honesty is more valuable than hype."
- Why: Reinforces alt-counsel brand positioning, memorable closing

### Final Stats

**Word count:** ~1,250 words
**Reading time:** ~6 minutes (target achieved)
**Structure:** 7 sections with clear progression
**Tone:** Honest, grounded, practical (matches alt-counsel brand)

### What Makes This Post Work

**1. Personal story with broader validation**
- Not just "I had problems" (whining)
- Not just "research says" (academic)
- Combination: "I built this following all patterns, and here's what broader evidence shows"

**2. Validates Morris while showing the gap**
- "Morris is right. Agents need different interfaces...But the gap is also real."
- Not contradicting the thesis, adding real-world nuance
- Constructive, not dismissive

**3. Concrete throughout**
- Specific tool (redlines v0.6.0)
- Specific failures (`--output markdown`)
- Specific research (32%, 7 modes, named firms)
- Specific recommendations (JSON default, human verification)

**4. Regional grounding**
- Singapore law firms experiencing same issues
- ASEAN constraints match audience constraints
- Practical approach ("baby steps") validates alt-counsel positioning

**5. Actionable takeaways**
- Don't over-invest in sophisticated features
- JSON by default works
- Human oversight essential
- Honest expectations > marketing hype

### Outstanding Items

**Before publishing:**
1. Add tags (probably: #AI #LegalTech #OpenSource #Python #AgentInterfaces)
2. Excerpt for Ghost (300 characters max)
3. Feature image (possibly GitHub repo image showing agent workflow?)
4. Jason Morris attribution (still need to verify LinkedIn post or adjust framing)
5. Schedule to coincide with redlines v0.6.0 PyPI release

**Post-publication:**
1. Share on LinkedIn with context about Morris's original post
2. Share on Mastodon (can quote the original witty post)
3. Consider cross-posting to relevant legal tech communities
