# Pitch: "I Built CLI Tools for Claude Code. Here's What I Learned About Designing for AI Users"

Jason Morris argues that "AI is a different kind of user, that needs a different kind of software, with a different kind of interface." I spent a month adapting my open-source library specifically for Claude Code with CLI commands and JSON outputsâ€”exactly the kind of purpose-built interface Morris describes. The results? Claude hallucinates commands, ignores documentation, and randomly refuses markdown output when explicitly requested. This post shares concrete examples of these failure modes and explores what the gap between theory and practice teaches us about building "AI-ready" tools. For solo counsels and legal tech builders experimenting with AI agents, these lessons help separate marketing promises from current reality, informing better decisions about where to invest limited resources when the tools simply aren't here yet.
