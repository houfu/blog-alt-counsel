# Pitch: "I Built CLI Tools for Claude Code. Here's What I Learned About Designing for AI Users"

Jason Morris argues that "AI is a different kind of user, that needs a different kind of software, with a different kind of interface." For redlines v0.6.0, I followed all the recommended patterns: agent integration guide (AGENT_GUIDE.md), discovery command (`redlines guide`), JSON-by-default output, enhanced error messages, and clear documentation. The results? Claude invents `--output markdown` flags that don't exist, never runs the discovery command I built for it, and ignores the agent-specific documentation. My plan was to make Claude work better with agent-friendly features. What actually worked: just defaulting to JSON, because Claude won't use the sophisticated stuff. This post shares concrete examples from adapting a top-10% PyPI library for AI agents and explores what the gap between best practices and reality means for solo counsels and legal tech builders with limited resources who can't afford to chase marketing promises.
