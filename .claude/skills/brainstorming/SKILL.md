# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Transform rough ideas into fully-formed designs through structured questioning and alternative exploration.

**Core principle:** Ask questions to understand, explore alternatives, present design incrementally for validation.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the Brainstorming skill to refine your idea into a pitch."

## The Process

### Phase 1: Understanding
- Check current state by reading the post, 'discussion.md' and other materials in the post folder
- Ask ONE question at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice when possible
- Gather: Purpose, constraints, success criteria

### Phase 2: Exploration
- Propose 2-3 different approaches
- For each: Core architecture, trade-offs, complexity assessment
- Ask your human partner which approach resonates

### Phase 3: Presentation
- For a new pitch: present in one or two paragraphs
- To edit an outline or post: show what you intend to change
- Ask after each section: "Does this look right so far?"

### Phase 4: Implementation
When the pitch or idea is approved and implementation will follow:
- New pitch: save the pitch in the post folder
- Edit an outline or post: make the change

### Phase 5: Record discussion
Create or update the 'discussion.md' in the post folder using recorder skill.

## When to Revisit Earlier Phases

**You can and should go backward when:**
- Partner reveals new constraint during Phase 2 or 3 → Return to Phase 1 to understand it
- Validation shows fundamental gap in requirements → Return to Phase 1
- Partner questions approach during Phase 3 → Return to Phase 2 to explore alternatives
- Something doesn't make sense → Go back and clarify

**Don't force forward linearly** when going backward would give better results.

## Remember
- One question per message during Phase 1
- Apply YAGNI ruthlessly
- Explore 2-3 alternatives before settling
- Present incrementally, validate as you go
- Go backward when needed - flexibility > rigid progression
- Announce skill usage at start
- For blog posts and newsletters, reference `/docs/Houfu_Voice_Guide.md` when exploring approaches
- Houfu's voice favors: frameworks over advice, nuance over binary thinking, vulnerable admissions over polished authority
