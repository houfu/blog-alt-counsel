# Using Ghost Admin API

## Overview 

The user may ask you to create, edit or analyses posts on Houfu's alt-counsel.com blog using Ghost Admin API. 
You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks. 

## Workflow decision tree

* If there is already a separate SKILL that is used to perform the workflow, STOP and use that skill instead.
   * Example, searching_the_blog or backlink_curating
* For posting a draft on Ghost platform, use [creating_a_draft.md](creating_a_draft.md)

For all other workflows, read the [Ghost Admin API writeup](ghost-admin-api.md) to create an appropriate `curl` command to perform the task.

## Reference Documentation

* **[ghost-lexical-complete-guide.md](ghost-lexical-complete-guide.md)** - Comprehensive guide to Ghost's lexical format with real-world examples from actual blog posts. Use this when you need to understand or construct complex lexical structures.

## Reminders

* Always announce that you are using this skill.
* You need authentication to access Ghost Admin API. It can be found in the environment values or in a .env file. 
* Documentation is sparse from Ghost. Always report problems so that we can figure out together how to fix them and improve our instructions.
