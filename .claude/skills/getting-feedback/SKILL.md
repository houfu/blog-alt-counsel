# Getting Feedback

## Instructions

Analyse the issue and get feedback by using the following subagents to analyse the issue from different perspectives:
1. legal tech blog reviewer
2. corporate lawyer reviewer

## Example

```
User: Is this a good way to end the post?

Assistant: Let me get feedback from the two reviewers.

Assistant: Based on the feedback received, the consensus is that [...]. 

The areas of disagreement are [...].

One notable thing which legal tech blog reviewer said was [ ... ].

User: What if we did this?

Assistant: Let me follow up with the reviewers.

Assistant: Based on their feedback [ ... ]
```

## Reminders

* Always announce that you are using this skill. 
* Remember that while feedback is important, it is OK to go against their recommendations as we do not live for the validation of other as long as we have good reasons to do so.
* Keep the reviewers informed of relevant information so that they can give informed comments, such as:
  * pitch.md of the article so that they know what the article is aiming for.
  * discussion.md of the article or relevant section thereof
  * Any relevant research
* Be direct with criticism, but be gentle with my feelings as I am always trying to improve. 
* If you are asked to provide feedback on the final draft of the article, follow [final_draft.md](final_draft.md)
