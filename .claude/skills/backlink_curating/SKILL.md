# Curating backlinks for a post

## Introduction

Backlinks are very important for a blog as it allows Houfu to continue to make use of work 
he has already done in news ways, inform readers of related content so that they can increase the
value of reading my blog, and apparently some SEO thing. 

## Process 

1. Read the post and its pitch to get a clear understanding of what the post is about and its structure.
2. Generate some search terms. 
3. Use the searching_the_blog skill in multiagent mode to uncover relevant posts. When searching posts, always get a summary or excerpt of the post.
4. Aim for about 3 relevant posts. If necessary, limit the number of related posts to 5 posts. 
5. Present your report to your human partner in the form of a table. For each related post, create a row with the columns, "Post title", "Relevance", "Link", and "Where to put this".

## Tips

* It may be necessary to search the blog again if your initiate search does not uncover enough results. However, give up after 10 searches even if there are not enough results.
* Try to distribute backlinks throughout the post. Don't crowd links in the "story so far" section of a post, if there is one.
