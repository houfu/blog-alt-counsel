2. **Regional relevance** - Singapore/ASEAN > Global > US/EU-specific
3. **Credibility** - Established publications > vendor blogs
4. **Specificity** - Actual data/examples > general statements
5. **Independence** - Journalistic sources > vendor marketing

## Red Flags

⚠️ Be cautious of:

- Enterprise-focused content (often doesn't apply to solo counsel context)
- Outdated pricing (legal tech pricing changes rapidly)
